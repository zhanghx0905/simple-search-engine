Add the first question.\n(Comment on this title)\n3 out of 3 people found the following comment useful:-\nPropaganda movie with a love triangle thrown in, 9 August 2005\nAuthor:\nblanche-2 from United States\nFantastic special effects highlight this World War II submarine drama\nstarring Tyrone Power, Dana Andrews, and Anne Baxter - Power's last\nbefore going into the Marines.Power is charming as a man who captures the heart of Anne Baxter, who\nthough he doesn't know it, just happens to be the girl of Dana Andrews,\nPower's new commanding officer.Out on the submarine, there's some exciting action as the sub searches\nfor a secret base set up by the Nazis. One interesting subplot is the\nfriendship of Oliver, a black soldier, with Mac, portrayed by James\nGleason. Ben Carter, who played Oliver, does a great job, and his role\nas a concerned friend and brave soldier is not the usual stereotypical\none blacks were often forced to play. The ending, of course, is pure propaganda as Power, supposedly talking\nto his uncle, talks about the fighting men, subs, PT boats, and the\nlike all doing their job. I'm in no way trying to denigrate it -\npropaganda is a fascinating part of film history and at that time was\ndeemed important to the war movement. It's all very interesting to view\ntoday. And Power is gorgeous.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Crash Dive (1943)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nLifeboat\nThe Guns of Navarone\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\nAction in the North Atlantic\nHell Below\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Add the first question.\n(Comment on this title)\nThe \"Fools\" are good, only the \"Chain\" is broken, 3 July 2005\nAuthor:\nBarky44 (brewpub44@snet.net) from United States\n\"Chain of Fools\" is one of those zany ensemble-cast spoofs on crime\nfilms. The \"Fools\" include Selma Hayek as a Playboy-posing police\nsergeant; Steve Zahn as an incompetent barber; Jeff Goldblum as a\ngeneric stylish thug; Elijah Wood as the world's youngest hit man;\nDavid Cross as an overgrown Boy Scout (literally); Tom Wilkinson as a\nvengeful wealthy industrialist; Orlando Jones as a beefy transvestite;\nand Lara Flynn Boyle as a treacherous ex-wife.Normally I love ensemble films, and this particular one had a great\ncast (well, Steve Zahn didn't particularly shine in this film, even\nthough he has the most screen time). The problem with CoF is the parts\naren't strung together that well. The plot is mediocre, the editing is\nhaphazard and the story doesn't flow too well at moments.But the characters do provide quite a few laughs themselves. So it's\nbetter than your average schlocky comedy.7 out of 10.Barky\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Chain of Fools (2000)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nhey!! help me!?!!?\nlove_english\nI don\u00b4t understand...\nqwertypwnerer\nFavorite Character?\nShawn_R_Hunter\nfound the DVD!\nglitterdream\nDavid Cross??\nbookely\nThe Song??!?!\nm-a-rc\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nThe Man Who Wasn't There\nThe Godfather: Part II\nThe Mexican\nSecondhand Lions\nIt's a Wonderful World\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Add the first question.\n(Comment on this title)\n2 out of 4 people found the following comment useful:-\nA truly bad sequel, 10 February 2005\nAuthor:\nkwheeley from United States\nWhy can't Hollywood just let good movies die in peace? This 2nd sequel\nto the original and quite good \"Smokey and the Bandit\" stinks\neverywhere. The story is lame and the characters have been reduced to\ncaricatures of themselves.Let's start with the story. The premise here is that those Enos boys\nare at it again, wanting to have some fun at the expense of someone.\nThat someone is none other than Sheriff Buford T. Justice (insert\nJackie Gleason's distinct, Southern lispy drawl) who has just put in\nfor retirement. When those retirement plans aren't what they originally\nseemed, our valiant Sheriff accepts the Enos' challenge: Deliver a\nplastic shark to the new restaurant the Enos boys opened up. While\nalong the way, those rascally Enos dudes are going to try to stop him\nat any cost.Okay, stop right there. In the first Bandit movie, the idea was a\nsimple challenge and bet. The Enos boys were depicted as nothing more\nthan a rich father and son team who were bored so they thought up a\ngood challenge. No real maliciousness involved - just a challenge with\nsome money put up to make people take it seriously. That was fun.In the 2nd Bandit movie, the Enos reputation (such as it is) is on the\nline and they want to beat a political rival. Not as strong, but again,\nnothing terribly malicious involved. This movie has them just trying to be mean to their new play toy.\nNamely, Sheriff Justice. So they send him on his way and start trying\nto sabotage his trip. When Justice beats them at every turn, they\nfigure that they need a professional to deal with him. Since the Bandit\nisn't around (he's off making \"Stroker Ace\") they give the job (and the\nred shirt, belt buckle and hat) to Cledus, our old truck driving buddy.So, Cledus chases Justice to get the prized shark and fun and laughter\nensue. Well, not too much fun and little laughter but look on the\nbright side - it was a paycheck for Gleason and Reed. Anyway, from there on out it becomes the now tired old cat-and-mouse\ngame with one side giving chase to the other. But even the chases lack\nthe polish to make you remember back to the ones in the 1977 original.\nThey seem more staged and one dimensional. For example, there's a scene\nwhere Cledus and a new buddy \"sneak\" up from behind and take the shark\noff of the Sheriff's car. The shot is not technically difficult and\nit's rather boring. Plus, what law enforcement officer doesn't check\nhis mirror to make sure of what's behind him? I learned that in 11th\ngrade driver's ed.Anway, to summarize, I think the use of the 1982 (anemic) Trans Am is\nallegorical to the rest of the cast: It's got the right name but is\nunder-thought, underpowered and basically is just a diluted version of\nits former self.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 (1983)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nfunny movie\nmrolympia_123\nGator Kicks\nrolykeates\nThe sand Plant\nrolykeates\nDid anyone here see the original version.\nMasterPain_2\nEditing\nID already taken\nanyone else notice..\njnoble11\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nSmokey and the Bandit II\nSmokey and the Bandit\nThe Cannonball Run\nThelma & Louise\nSpeed Zone!\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

But in the end the village residents will have much\nto remember him by.Of course Zatoichi is in a sentimental mood. There is a funny scene\nwhere Zato mistakenly thinks that the town has set up a big banquet in\nhis honor and he frets over how to greet his guests and thank them.\nThere is a touching scene where Zato comes across a Jizo (Buddha)\nstatue along side a road where he used to play as a child. Jizo is\nmissing his stone head, so Zatoichi gets on hands and knees to find the\nmissing head. In the end he finds the head and replaces it on Jizo's\nshoulders. Zato visits the grave of his 'aunti' who breast fed him and\noffers sake (taking a nip himself :) ).The second half of the film is fast paced and has an interesting story.\nIt's a story of greed and the story is being sown by Zatoichi's\nchildhood friend, who has returned to the village at the same time as\nZatoichi. Their confrontation is predictable, but Zatoichi takes out a\nhost of yakuza to eventually confront his childhood friend. Overall,\nit's a compelling story and has a lot of good action.So this film marks the 25th film in a period of 12 years. It's\ninteresting that the series pauses at this point. The next film (and\nlast) will be released in 1989. I would rank Zatoichi Conspiracy higher\nthan several of the earlier films in the series, but the Japanese\npublic must have had enough by this point.

Not knowing much about\nLatin America in general, I was not aware of what went on in Haiti -\nthen, and even now. This was such a powerful film portraying Jean\nDominique, the Haitian journalist who spoke out against successive\ndictatorships on Radio Haiti. I feel he resembles how Martin Luther\nKing, in the way he spoke to become the \"voice of the people\" and his\nunending passion to pursue freedom, opportunity and human rights for\nthe Haitian peasantry.I recall one part of the film that caught my attention. The foreign\nsoldiers scene discussing \"The Battle of Vertieres\" that occurred on\nNovember 18, 1803. Composed of escaped Haitian slaves form the Haitian\nRevolutionary Army,demolish Napoleon's Colonial Forces. Here, Jean\nDominique's father tells him when he's just a young boy seeing soldiers\npass his house, \"You are from this land, you are not French, you are\nnot British, you are not American. You are Haitian!\" I feel Dominique's\npassion to fight for human rights from the elite were rooted in him by\nhis father.Dominique stood for the values of open inquiry, justice and freedom.\nThe documentary provides the world with the insight of this fearless\nman who wanted to do good in the world. I hope someday his assassins\nare found and justice is served.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for The Agronomist (2003)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nWhat's Your...\nANGEL_407\nJohnathan Demme\nRosenKratz\nsoundtrack?\nerincmedley\nEntertaining, but needs more political context\nSurrenderToto\nBest movie about a soil and plant scientist ever...\nPFEKing\nUrgent Help!!!\nblanco353\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nThe Trials of Henry Kissinger\nAmerican Blackout\nThe Real Malcolm X\nParagraph 175\nAleut Story\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

You may not understand what I mean\nby\nthat but I'll explain.I am pretty young (15 yrs. old) but mature to some my age! I love \"love\nstories\". And on average now you usually see the young/beautiful (in some\nppl's opinions) people in love movies! And to see Diane & Jack play these\nroles.. and basically show that even when you are at that age how devine\nit\nis :) In my opinion I think Diane is beautiful also. My point is: I really\nenjoy seeing the older couples sometimes on screen... to know what my\nparents exactly go there & feel (but never tell me) like that. B/c that isreality and truth -not just your young love, we don't stay young forever\nlol! But yes I know there are movies that have older couples, but they are\nusually just there. I mean on average movies most of the time excuse the\nfact that how much in love they still are (which I adore)... especially\nlike\nthis movie!Alright on to the movie -I have read what people have been saying that\nSomething's Gotta Give is predictable. Uhm well of course, I knew how it\nKINDA baselined to be from trailers also. But come on how many love\nstories\ndo that?? They end up falling in love.. then have troubles.. at the end\nget\ntogether! A LOT. But to those who are reading this right now: IT IS NOT\n*ALL* PREDICTABLE!!I love Keanu Reeves in this movie! He is very sweet and truly in love.. he\nwas just right. I actually enjoyed him the best (besides Diane & Jack's\nlove). Why you might ask? Hm.. let me just say Keanu played a better guy\nthen Jack (him being a young ladies man/player).But all in all I really liked it! At times (cus of its length) it may drag\na\nlittle, but that is it's only faults. It has enough humor/love/sweetness,\nlol, to make it a great movie!! It all depends on your tastes too (I've\nheard from various ppl that mainly it's a married woman's type of movie).\nBut anyone could like it I believe, so at your very least... you can rent\nit, hopefully then it'll be led to buying it :DI give it a 8.5/10! *Alaina\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Something's Gotta Give (2003)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nNicholson's cell phone\nuberpike\nMarin's Husband and Pregnancy\nNicoliHP\nhave you ..?\nnrjetik81\nedited for TV\nsnowboardgirl290\nthe absolutely BEST quote of this movie is missing in the quotes section\nalvaro2908-1\nContraception......\nmy_i_me_mine\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nThe Notebook\nSaving Face\nSomething New\nThe Phantom of the Opera\nPlayboy Video Centerfold: The Dahm Triplets\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

They're brilliant\nworks.But this is horrifically off the mark.The review of Davies' version of Edith Wharton's *House of Mirth* in\nthe NY Times said that the movie was more like Charles Dickens than\nEdith Wharton. Which is exactly the criticism I had of this movie.\nThese folks are not embodying American Southern farmers, they're acting\nlike industrial working class people. I can understand and be\nsympathetic to the original story: my people, coming from South\nCarolina & Georgia, had lives very similar to the plot of this movie.\nTherefore, I could see where this could potentially be a very good\nfilm.But nothing gets under my skin like an inability to see beyond one's\nown cultural bias...which is the major mistake of the director of this\nproduction. If you take the emotions, the gestures, the imagery of this\nfilm and put them in an industrial landscape, it would be an OK movie.\nBut having people interact and react this way and have them being\nfarmers in the Deep South is bogus, phony and w-a-y off the mark.

The plot of a timid ordinary citizen being mistaken for a hardened criminal and becoming involved in catching the crooks goes back in US film history at least to John Ford's The Whole Town's Talking (1935), a comedy-drama that starred Edward G. Robinson in a similar dual role.\nmore\nGoofs:\nContinuity: When Troshkin is being hit by Mikola in prison, Troshkin's pants already have a dirt mark in the back, most probably from rehearsals.\nmore\nQuotes:\nVasily Alibabayevich:\n[Reading Khmyr's child's letter] Dear dad! When mom and I found out that you were in jail, we got very excited. And mom also got very excited because we thought you were dead.

Add the first question.\n(Comment on this title)\n22 out of 22 people found the following comment useful:-\nA truly classic Russian comedy, 10 April 2002\nAuthor:\nGeorge Freedman (geosochi@yahoo.com) from Glendale, California\nThis is my favorite Russian comedy, and although it is 30 years old, people\nstill enjoy it more than most other comedies today. A satiric and witty\nmovie that revolves around an adventurous plot. The plot is basically that\na\nconvict (Dotsent) escapes from prison and the militia (Russian police) find\nthe criminal's lookalike, a kindergarten teacher. He goes undercover and\npretends to be a criminal to help the militia find the where the real\nconvict has hidden a stolen mask. He makes a phony escape from the prison\nwith two others, who think he is the real Dotsent. He eventually befriends\nwith them and they become attached, but I won't reveal the rest. From my\nplot review it might seem as a violent movie or something like that, but\nactually it is good for the entire family. The movie is entertaining\nthroughout and if you want to see a comparison with an American equivalent,\nit's like a lot like Seinfeld because it's a situational comedy. If you are\na fan of Russian cinematography and haven't seen this one, watch it right\naway because this is a true classic with some of the greatest Russian\nactors\n(see cast).\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Gentlemeny udachy (1972)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nThe Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear\nBal-Can-Can\nSreda obitaniya\nThe Whole Town's Talking\nMimino\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

This\nis not really a comedy per se, as there is a dramatic element to it,\nand the performances should not be so easily dismissed.Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves look good together; Keanu is not\nplaying a superficial action role, so the focus is not on him. This is\na good thing, especially as we can then appreciate Charlize Theron's\nperformance as Sara Deaver, a quirky girl who Nelson (Keanu) meets at\nthe DMV in San Francisco. San Francisco is an interesting backdrop- the\npositive aspects of it are emphasized, and it becomes another character\nin the film.Jason Isaccs plays Chaz Cherry, the local cross-dresser who is Theron's\nfriend and confidante. He does well in this, and last night I actually\nsaw him in \"Friends With Money\", wherein his talent was literally\nwasted. Liam Aiken portrays Abner, who is quasi-adopted by Theron and\nReeves, as their relationship develops.There are some funny scenes, like where Greg Germann (Reeves' co-worker\nat an ad agency) orders cappuccino and is told off by the waitress.\nAlso where Reeves is presenting an ad campaign for hot dogs, and he\neventually flips out.The film works because it is not a gushing romance film; I am not a big\nfan of Reeves but he was very good in this film. Theron was excellent,\nas always, and there are some beautiful shots of the Bay in San\nFrancisco, a nice backdrop for a bittersweet romance.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Sweet November (2001)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nThe ending made me cry\nsst1987\nAutumn in NY\nLaney_girl08\nKeanu singing\nrosie_rou\nShe doesn't die.\nnicholassixx\n'take the 80 to Oakland'\nnam-turk\nwhat is ernie!??\nkrxy04\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nSabrina\nThe Other Sister\nHere on Earth\nBeaches\nJerry Maguire\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

At\nfirst, she's just a pawn in a situation that she wasn't supposed to be\na part of, but as each person gets killed coming after the money, she\nbecomes the aggressor and wants to keep the money badly so that she can\nstart life anew in another country. This movie is thrilling,\nexhilarating, comic, tragic, frightening and full of twists and turns.\nThe woman in the middle of everything is played superbly by Lalita\nPanyopas as she gets deeper and deeper into her situation and becomes\nmore and more hardlined. As she cleans the blood from her apartment\nafter each killing she breaks down only once, and then gives into her\nobsession completely during a wonderful scene where she lets her best\nfriend see what's been going on in her life lately as she dumps the\nbodies in a nearby lake. This is one of those \"one of a kind\" foreign\nmovies that grips you more and more as it goes on. Americans; please\ndon't be frightened by subtitles, the blood, or the fact that we get to\nsee a couple of individuals urinate into a toilet!! Let's grow up!!\nThis is a great thriller from Thailand that should be enjoyed by a lot\nof people, not just by those who speak the same language and know the\nway things are in the country it was made.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Ruang talok 69 (1999)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nThis movie is way underrated.\nquantaumfoam\nOne of the best films...\nwiseman-4\nmusic for 69\nalec886\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nOng-bak\nThe Whole Nine Yards\nThe Winner\nOne Eight Seven\nAnother 48 Hrs.\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Her supporting actors, Sig Ruman used every expression he\ncould to portray a fumbling Russian and Bela Lugosi showed the movie\nindustry that he had great acting abilities he was never given a chance show\nto his many fans.This film shows aspiring actors just how to perform to the highest level of\ntheir art.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Ninotchka (1939)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nloved it\njigova\nBela Lugosi\nOneMind\nColdwar Romance\nKensith\nOne of 3 most funny movies I ever saw!\nSpongeAnya_SquarePants\n110 or 136 min?!\nazarel\nAre there a double of Garbo in Ninotchka film?\nmercecm\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nGentlemen Prefer Blondes\nCasablanca\nRuggles of Red Gap\nShakespeare in Love\nMoulin Rouge!\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

After a\nhalf an hour of snickering at some awkward scenes, I gradually\nbegan to get hooked, and by the time thepowerful climax arrived,\nthe director and the actors had won me over. Sure, the film isn't\nperfect and some scenes don't work, but rarely do Latinos get 30\nmillion dollars to make their personal films, if given the chance to\nmake films at all. Despite what some people have written about\nthis film, the cinematography is excellent, and so are some of the\nactors like Jacob Vargas, and the guy who played Gramps is\nterrifying. The director did a great job with the few resources he\nhad and his heart and passion are evident in every frame. One\nthing that bothers me, particularly from fellow Latinos, is that\nthey're always ready to knock a film like this by calling it negative,\nor calling it \"typical\" or saying things like \"not all latinos grew up in\nthe hood\". Fine. Make your own movie! If you don't like hood\nmovies don't watch them, but don't knock a filmmaker for making a\nmovie about something he cares about, just like I wouldn't knock\nScorcese for making another \"gangster picture\", or the coen\nBrothers for making another \"film noir\" picture. Film is film, and if\nit's well done I'm ready to give it a shot, regardless of the subject\nmatter.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Road Dogz (2000)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nMy Family\nThe Ice Storm\nWelcome to the Dollhouse\nThe Virgin Suicides\nLiberty Heights\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

That inspired me to get this VHS, but I didn't find him\nanything special. I guess he's someone who appeals a lot more to women.\nThey seemed to go nuts over him, really getting into his songs as one\ncan see on this concert tape.Actually, after awhile the women are annoying to watch, being a little\nover-dramatic in the audience. That's nothing new. They did it back in\nFrank Sinatra's heyday, and with Elvis and then the Beatles, etc. Anyway, I have no complaints about the music. I've always liked most of\nDiamond's numbers and he does them justice in this concert filmed at\nthe Aquarius Theatre in Los Angeles, Ca., in 1988. Most of the songs in\nthis are solid, but I'd rather listen to him and see all the stupid\nwomen making fools of themselves in the audience.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Neil Diamond: Greatest Hits Live (1988) (V)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nJohn Denver: The Wildlife Concert\nAlabama: 41 Number One Hits Live\nRolling Stone Presents Twenty Years of Rock & Roll\nA Night in Havana: Dizzy Gillespie in Cuba\nJimi Plays Monterey\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

For\na person like me who is born in the late 80s actually, I am do aware\nhow huge the four lads from Liverpool are.As this is about the life of John Lennon, from his early days to the\ntime he was with the Beatles, the TV movie is more focused about him\nand his life. The time when Beatlemania is everywhere, it was not\nignored in the TV movie as well.Given I am only aware of the Beatles' success, so much of what's\nhappening in the TV movie is an eye-opener for someone like me.It's quite an insight.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for In His Life: The John Lennon Story (2000) (TV)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nthis movie should of have been a two part mini series\nmclancey21\nGoofs\ntodd-175\nHelp\nalexgiareta\nCopies??\nbluestategirl\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nBackbeat\nBirth of the Beatles\nJohn and Yoko: A Love Story\nThe Buddy Holly Story\nMasked and Anonymous\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

His self deprecating style is simply perfect and\nextraordinarily funny.I have seen this show several times on cable and I laugh often and out\nloud\nthroughout every time. The opening 20 minutes have some of the funniest\nstuff I have ever heard particularly the bits about his relationships.\nAnd\nhis description of Jim Brown trying to save him from crack addiction and\nthe\nstories of his subsequent hospitilization for burn treatment are\nhilarious.Highly recommended.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip (1982)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nRichard Pryor ...Here and Now\nRichard Pryor: Live in Concert\nRichard Pryor: Live and Smokin'\nEddie Murphy Raw\nEddie Murphy Delirious\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Add the first question.\n(Comment on this title)\n1 out of 1 people found the following comment useful:-\nA masterpiece !, 26 May 2006\nAuthor:\nwmjahn from Austria\nDid anyone notice that Charlie made 2 of his best (maybe his best)\npictures one after another, both directed by Michael Winner (who did\nsome more nice entries in the Bronson catalog), both scored by Jerry\nFiedling (superbly, if I may add), \"CHATO'S LAND\" and \"THE MECHANIC\"\n(from whom Tarantine chose to quote in \"Kill Bill II\") ??!! I must have\nwatched both movies app. half a dozen times and they seem to get better\nwith every viewing (despite knowing its ending)! First, these are films made for men, not children or family-viewing.\nAnd let's be honest, if you wanna see a good, though, well played movie\ntoday, what you're gonna do?? Certainly not go to the cinema, were you\nsee noisy, trashy high-budget trash in a row. You buy yourself a DVD or\nwatch some late-night viewing of a 70ies movie on TV! And these two\nmovies are certainly as good as it can get! Second, these movies are more less silent! You don't hear some silly\ndialog through it all, but just men saying a few words, when it's\nreally needed. Those people, who talk a lot in such movies, are happily\nthe first ones that gonna be shot (and it's good this way)! Everybody's\nalways pointing out who little Arnold is saying in \"TERMINATOR\" (of\ncourse the first one), a real good movie, too! Well, get yourself\nCHATO'S LAND. In the German dubbed version good old Charlie (God bless\nhim!) spoke less than 10 words in German and maybe another dozen or so\nin some tribal language, that's it! I'd take a bet that there is most\nlikely no other non-silent movie every made, in which the hero says as\nfew words as in this one!! And while we're at comparing it to Schwarzenegger/Terminator, did\nanybody notice those MUSCLES of Charlie??!! And these are certainly no\nanabolic-stuff, but real hard & honest earned ones! If we'd take\nCharlie in his prime (when he made this one, he was HALF A CENTURY OLD\n= 50 years!!!) and compare it to Schwarzenegger, when he was 50 not\nthat long ago ... I'd say Charlie would have wiped the carpet with him,\nshould there have been any reason for an argument. I'd just wish I'd\nhave looked that well, when I was 30, not to speak of being 50 (not\nyet).The guy is just SO COOL in this movie as well as in THE MECHANIC (and\nmany more in fact))! OK, I hear the critics saying, this is just a \"silly\" revenge-movie\n(note: made before DEATH WISH I !!). Nope, it ain't !! First, it's not\nthat important, what the story is, what really counts is how it is\ndelivered: movie-experts doing what they can at the highest level! It's\njust GREAT to watch them delivering all the expected scenes without\ngetting whimsical, talky or making compromises. This is a men's movie\nmade for men! And second, it's not stupid at all! Why does everybody\nhas to go on his knees in front of authorities (the sheriff)? Esp. if\nyou're part of a badly treated minority! He's on his own, when a big\ncrowd invades HIS LAND (like the USA did in Vietnam) and he wipes them\noff. He knows the land better than everybody else, he's trained and\nintelligent (the followers are more stupid, but not completely), so he\ndoes what he has to do. At the end the winner is logical and probably\nthat's the movie, Mr. Bush should have watched before entering the\nIraque ...OK, back to the movie. What about the acting? Wooden??? Come on, it\nain't, it's just perfect for this movie!! Would you like to see some\nwhat-they-call-\"actor\"-today (say, Adrien Brody, who wasn't too\nconvincing in KING KONG either) delivering this?? It would just be\n\"strange\"/ridiculous. And the other members of the crew? Just perfect!\nPalance, superb (as always, but he should have avoided City Slickers),\nBasehart and Whitmore, great! Just the kinda support crew one needs and\nwhich is simply non-existent today (and which is sadly missed!).One critic complained about the \"cheap look\" (??) of the movie, and\nthat it must have been inexpensive to make. Well, so what? First,\nblockbusters suck anyway, every 2 minutes an explosion is just noisy\nand boring (but obviously expensive) anyway and the scenery is in fact\nsuperbly chosen! It's just THE MAN, the scenery and his doomed\nfollowers. The land is as bleak as the fate of the followers/hunters.\nIt's empty, it's pure, it's honest, it's something for \"desert-rats\".\n:-)) So to sum up: you can't chose better for a great action movie of\nthe 70ies (and that'w when most of the great actions movies were\nmade!).Moreless the same can be said about THE MECHANIC: tough, not-talky,\nthrilling, superbly shot and acted, great support cast, too, and what\nan ending !!! I'd LOVE to see these out on DVD with much bonus material\n(scenes from the set, one of Carlies too rare interviews: well, the guy\nstayed silent when there was not much too say, smile, although I would\nlove him to still be among us and write some great autobiography!)!What a loss, but then again he's hopefully having superb times,\nwherever he's now!\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Chato's Land (1972)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nBRONSON at his best - areal masterpiece!\nwmjahn\nApache Kid\nsnoorton\nWhy had the 2 last guys have to suffer most?

For a young director, Ms. Paci, shows a lot of talent in\nthe way she has constructed the film and in the performances she gets\nfrom her actors.The film presents the story of Gilda, a young woman getting over the\ndeath of her father. At the same time, it's revealed, accidentally, her\nfather might have been involved with another woman. Her reaction is not\ntypical, as she decides to go away to her grandparents in New York as a\nway to rebel against her mother. She also goes hoping to meet an actor\nwho she has been obsessed with.Getting to know this man proves to be a let down for Gilda. This young\nwoman feels betrayed by all the men she had loved and suddenly realizes\nwhere she belongs and returns home to make peace with her mother, who\nGilda has blamed, in a way, for all that has gone wrong in her life.Susan May Pratt, is Gilda. Her performance seems effortless. Chris Noth\nis perfect as the egotistical Michael De Santis, the well known actor\nand the object of Gilda's love. Laila Robins, an extraordinary actress\nwho works in the New York theatre extensively, brings an intelligent\napproach to Gilda's mother, who has also been betrayed by her husband.\nMary Louise Wilson and Josef Sommer make brief appearances as Gilda's\ngrandparents. Also, Michele Placido is seen as Giorgio.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Searching for Paradise (2002)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nI f you could get a celeb to take you to their hotel room who?\nmagicpowers\nwhere????\nswxt_avenged7x\nPlease tell me someone else saw this\npotblackettle\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nMenace II Society\nThe Mighty\nEdge\nNebraska\nDonnie Darko\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Add the first question.\n(Comment on this title)\nwe can hope for better, 5 June 2001\nAuthor:\nxhari_nairx from Oakland, CA\nI'm always on the look out for American films that actually acknowledge that\nthere are more than two races in America.Unfortunately, while YELLOW does\nin fact feature Korean Americans, it fails in too many ways.The title\nitself is an in-your-face attempt to say \"Hey!! THIS is\nAsian-Americanism!!!\"The characters seem to have been created to fulfill\nthe film maker's desire to represent Korean Americans.That's a trap that a\nlot of films about ethnic minorities fall into, but sometimes with skilled\nwriting that purpose can be fulfilled while still creating characters that\nseem real.Not so in this case, and in fact, they characters and story\ndon't give you any genuine feel for the issues facing Korean Americans\nanyway.No point in taking the actors to task for their performances... the\nfinest thespians couldn't make these character's motivations tangible.The\nstory suffers from the \"dummy-plot\" syndrome.... there would be no story if\nthe characters weren't stupid.The story drifts aimlessly from one\ncontrived event to another.It eventually reaches such levels of\nridiculousness that you're wondering if the film maker just added scenes in\nbecause it would be fun to shoot.That all being said... Chris Chan Lee\nmight have a good film in him.At times he displays a good visual sense.\nMaybe if he was working with a writer who could craft a convincing story\nwith genuine emotion.But unfortunately, YELLOW is a film worth watching\nonly if you're writing a term paper on Asian American film.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Yellow (1998)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nAny similar?\nmeis760-1\nMichael Chung\nyoungjun91\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nBaby It's You\nIs It College Yet?\nMy Best Friend's Wife\nThe Perfect Weapon\nDo the Right Thing\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

I guess its a case of - you take your pick - whichever scenario\nyou feel like going with.The story concerns Dr. Ty Adams, a handsome young man, who feels mental\npatients can be cured by therapy, that medication is not needed.He comes to Sedah Hospital to prove his theory, and to have it all\nfilmed by cameras set up throughout the institute as well as a camera\ncrew being present.The main patients Dr. Adam's deals with are Cheryl a young woman who\nwas badly abused as a child and who tends to go into defensive rages\ncombined with depressive withdrawal, and a man who claims he is Satan.Why Satan voluntarily admits himself to the mental hospital is never\nexplained.

It's a wonderful translation of the story in\nthe since that all the warmth is there. When fall comes along it FEELS\nlike fall (same as in the animated version of Ray Bradbury's The\nHalloween Tree). Debbie Reynolds' voice is beautiful for Charlotte and\nfit the animated character's blue/gray smiling face. I'd dare say the\nstory comes across better than some of Disney's most recent stuff\n(though I'd still have to bow down to Beauty and The Beast, one of my\nall-time faves). As far as animation goes, Charlotte's Web proves once\nagain that it's all about story; the most beautiful animation in the\nworld can't save a lousy story...no matter what. And I highly doubt\nthat the new live action version coming out will be half as charming as\nthis animated classic. I could be wrong. I hope I'm wrong...but I doubt\nit.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Charlotte's Web (1973)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nCall me Crazy\nChunkyCheese\nDoes anyone not find this movie hilarious?\njsandlin71\nDVD copy from Charlotte's Web original version\nliza_jouve\nTakamoto dead\nMetFanMac\nThe kids loved it!\nraymond-massart\nWho here has seen the live-action remake?\nMetFanMac\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nCharlotte's Web\nThe Fox and the Hound\nBabe\nThe Muppets Take Manhattan\nWinnie the Pooh and Tigger Too!\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

She gets a job at the Spitfire Grill\nrun by Hannah (Burstyn). Starting over in a small New England town with\nits clannish ways and suspicions of strangers is not easy and Percy has\na hard row to hoe.A friend of mine said they don't make movies like this anymore and he\nis right. The owner of the Prime Time Video store says this movie is\nalways going out the door and did surmise that it might be a cult\nmovie. He has not seen it yet. Well, it's not a cult movie. It's simply\na very good story.It's a wonderful true to life story about three women (Gay Harden being\nthe other one) who carry their baggage with them and try to get by.\nPercy is haunted by her past; Hannah is guilt-ridden regarding her\nfamily; and Shelby (Gay Harden) is tormented by her husband. All three\nneed each other to understand each is not alone.I went back to 1996 and 1997 to see if this movie or stars had been\nnominated for anything in the Academy Awards. Nothing was found, but\nthere should have been something or someone nominated. I would have\nguessed that Marcia Gay Harden would have been nominated for a best\nsupporting actress award. She would have had my vote.Although made in 1996, I suppose this is the type of movie that goes\nout the door a lot because of word of mouth. If you see this movie,\npass it on.

Well, it's definitely low-brow, but it also has some gags that\nare undeniably clever. Is it racist? Yeah, a little, but it's also\nsatirizing old stereotypes about \"Dark Africa.\" Is it immature and and\ngross\nand sophomoric and over-the-top? Yes. Yes, it is.But someone (well, me) once said the only thing comedies have to be is\nfunny. And this movie is dang funny. Need I remind anybody of the scene\nwhere Ace insists on dropping a slinky down the hundreds of steps leading\nup\nto a Buddhist temple? (\"It was RIGHT there!\") Or the slideshow in which\nAce's hand appears to greedily devour a poacher's crotch? That's just\nhilarious!The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't settle for outlandish\nset-ups that only seem to be jokes. This movie gets full bang for its\ncomedic buck. Do we have a fight with a crocodile presented\nin-and-of-itself\nas humor? No! In a lesser film, perhaps. But Ace Ventura goes the extra\nmile, bringing us childish schoolyard taunts (\"Stop hittin' yourself! Stop\nhittin yourself!\") And is it enough to have Ace chasing the villain through\nthe jungle in a monster truck? No - he actually pulls up next to him and\nutters a bon mot worthy of Groucho. Also, where did that monster truck comefrom?! The sheer resolve not to explain the truck's presence is a sublimely\nsatirical dig at movies that might place monster trucks in the jungle just\nfor cheap, lazy wackiness.This movie is anything but lazy. Jim Carrey, like no actor before him,\npulls\nout all the stops as Ace Ventura. Is he milking things? Oh sure. He's\nmilking things like Paganini milked the violin, or like Michelangelo milked\nthe Sistine Chapel. He's inventing a manic persona so complete and fully\nrealized, that it transcends standard comedy and achieves something\nmystical\nand poetic and truthful. And that's how it keeps from being\nannoying.This film is too casually dismissed because it looks like a terrible movie.\nI was hesitant to watch it. But maybe, years and years from now, it will\nachieve the kind of subversive cult-film status it deserves.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nFavorite Quote!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!\niFkinHATEbooks\nFavorite Jim Carey Movie?\nJohnv711\nAce Ventura 3\nPsychlOps\nWachati Princess\nmangemoi69\nWhat is\nbubblicious95124\nthe song?\nSharpzy\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nMe, Myself & Irene\nDumb & Dumber\nNutty Professor II: The Klumps\nThe Nutty Professor\nGet Over It\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

These are without doubt the best live\nperformances i have ever seen. The first concert was Stevie Ray's first\nappearance at the Montreux jazz were the crowd showered him in boo's\nand hisses. Even though the crowd didn't think so the concert was\namazing and proved to be one of his most important concerts. The second\nconcert was even better. The crowd were now familiar with Stevies music\nand greeted him with the respect and reception that he deserved. If you\nare a fan of guitar music, blues or rock then you will love the unique\nstyle of Stevie Ray Vaughan. Its just a pity that he died so soon. His\nmusic will live on forever.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble: Live at Montreux 1982 & 1985 (2004) (V)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nI Wanna Be a Republican\nConcert for George\nRush in Rio\nBruce Springsteen & the E Street Band\nFearless Freaks\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

It had\nthe usual flaws that any 90's film would have but overall it was a\ngreat movie. This film was very close into being perfect. One thing\nmovies like to add is loads of comedy not realizing that comedy takes\naway from an complete impact. However the movie is made so well that\neven though I knew who the killer was before I saw the movie, I was\nstill shocked in this movie. The three stars have excellent chemistry\nand sadly weren't paired up again. Bobby Deol is a better actor now,\nbut he wasn't that great in this movie. He has no facial expression and\na weak body language. Sad, because his elder brother mastered at facial\nexpression. Kajol was amazing, and surprisingly was given a very little\nchance to act. However, she proves that four scenes can still let her\nsteal the show. Koirala was excellent. She is given a less meatier role\nthan Kajol, but performs very well as she has more scenes. This role\nwas not given any recognition, but she looked extremely beautiful, and\nshe should portray roles like this. Om Puri and Paresh Rawal were\nbrilliant. Om Puri played an excellent cop, and Paresh Rawal was\nmesmerizing. The main flaw was that the songs got in the way. The only\nsongs that were portrayed properly were Mere Khabown Mein Tu (In My\nDreams Are You), which is a nice song, Yeh Pyar Kya Hai (What is this\nLove) which had nice choreography and was nice to watch. The other good\nsong was Mushkil Bada Yeh Pyar Hai (The Love is Really Hard) which was\na very long song and got boring. Anyways the movie was nice, and is a\ntreat to watch.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Gupt: The Hidden Truth (1997)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nHeaven\nChicago\nGunaah\nThe Hard Word\nLet Him Have It\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

It doesn't show in \"Funny Face\" either, but her natural gamine\nappeal does seem to get swallowed up in the fake-happy surroundings.\nThe Oscar-nominated screenplay about a famous photographer discovering\na beauty in a mousy Greenwich Village book-clerk is only good in its\nearly stages setting up the story, but when we find that the plot is\njust a romance complication, it's a let-down. The plot-thread about the\nphilosopher in Paris is dire, and the film laughably compares a beatnik\nlecture to a spiritual, but Hepburn works hard to create chemistry\nbetween she and Fred Astaire (older and less enthused) and she has some\nfeisty, enchanting moments. She does her own singing here, unlike in\nthe later \"My Fair Lady\" (which coincidentally also gave Audrey a\nfashionable makeover), and her dancing is sprightly and fun. It's a\nfluttery, gay, fashion-magazine movie without enough soul in it to\nreally be absorbing, but the Gershwin songs are sweet and the\neye-popping color-schemes give it a great visual kick. ** from ****\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Funny Face (1957)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nWhy is 'Funny Face' loved??\nclassics4me\nThe Clothes\ncrazygirl2306\nGreat Audrey Film..\ncalisa\nFake romance\nvinum90035\nWho choreographed what?

Though he's totally\nunrecognizable with a long beard, Stallone does an exceptionally good\nperformance because unlike his other cop roles, such as Ray Tango from\n\"Tango and Cash\", Sly doesn't portray a cocky character, which makes it very\nrealistic. However, our hero doesn't show his muscles in this flick, but, it\nproves that you don't have to be brawny to be a tough guy.\nHauer is also perfect, playing what he does best, an oily villian. He might\nlook very suave at first in this film, but when he shows his true colors,\nyou better watch out. Last but not least is Billy Dee Williams, who does a\ncool Roger Murtaughesque cop who relies on his partner Sly to do the\njob.If you're in the mood for suspense and good chase scenes, \"Nighthawks\" is\nyour gameplan.

The\nchoreography and dancing is the best I've seen in fifty years of\n'dance' movies. Patrick Swayze, his wife Lisa Niem, George De La Pena\nare supposed to be over-the-hill dancers, but in real life...they are\nfar from it.

I admit this movie is manipulative, and probably exaggerated for\npurposes of drama, but what based-on-a-true story movies aren't? At\nleast it goes after the right things: a father having custody of his\nkids, rather than them being forced to live in an \"institution.\"The story is based a true situation in the mid 1950s Ireland in which,\nin the end, the Irish Constitution was amended because of this case.\n\"Desmond Doyle\" (Pierce Brosnan) is the loving father whose wife runs\noff one day with another man, leaving him with three little kids and\nlittle visible means of support. Since he didn't have enough finances,\nthe government makes the kids wards of the state and places them in\nCatholic schools-homes (institutions?).On that Catholic, or \"religious,\" angle, you get a lot of positive and\nnegative scenes here. You have a bad, nasty almost sadistic nun \"Sister\nBrigid,\" but the others are fine caring ladies, as they should be.\nOverall, however, you see a lot of faith portrayed in this film and\nit's mostly good. Of course, that faith was more out in the open in the\n'50s than today, but it was inspiring to see in many parts.Brosnan is excellent in the lead role, a man everyone can identify\nwith: a loving but flawed man. He drinks too much, he swears, he\ndoesn't have a steady job but he has great heart and has great\ndetermination to the right thing. One has no trouble rooting for him in\nthis story. I think it's the best role he has ever played, far better\nthan his superficial James Bond or thieves roles he normally plays.But\nnobody hits you as emotionally as little Evelyn (Sophie Vavasseur), one\nof Doyle's three kids and the one that is focused upon here. (The two\nlittle brothers are not given much screen time, for some reason.)\nBrosnan's allies in here - the two lawyers (played by Stephen Rea and\nAiden Quinn) are likable as is Alan Bates who plays a rugged\nex-barrister who winds up helping the team. Bates might have had the\nbest role for the supporting actors.This is such an involving story, one that you really care about the\npeople, it can bring a tear or two in the end, but what's wrong with\nthat? When you are finished watching this film, you feel good.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Evelyn (2002)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nirish accents\ngreys_obsessy\nA Evelyn Music Video\nbut448\nWORST BOND MOVIE EVER!!\nbonsai_midget\nMy explination on why the movie was more about 'Evelyn' and not the boys\nDV96\nWhy is this film called Evelyn?\nLalena1\nVery good but...\noc7000\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nMommie Dearest\nThe Game of Their Lives\nCatch Me If You Can\nSuperman\nChariots of Fire\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

I thought it would be a remake of Titanic and it was in\nthe first half a bit like it but in the second half it was totally\ndifferent. Aamir Khan was good and played the charming hero, Manisha\nKoirala\nwas fantastic and Anil Kapoor was excellent!The film is about Dev Karan Singh (Aamir Khan), who is a womanizer who is\nalready engaged to some rich brat but still goes after the woman but never\nactually loves any of them until one day he goes on a cruise and meets a\ngirl he's crazy about Priya (Manisha Koirala), who won in a fancy dress\ncontest to go on a cruise. Priya and dev meet and dev hits on her the first\ntime he sees her and later she gets to love him too and goes along with him\nto meet his grandma (Sharmila Tagore). The two reveal they're both getting\nengaged and vow to break of their marriages and meet at the gateway of\nindia\non valentine's day and Priya says to Dev to make something of himself and\nstand on his own two feet. At the airport their partners to be arrive to\npick them up and Priya's alliance turns out to be Anil Kapoor and Dev's\nalliance turns out to be someone who i don't know the name of and there the\ntwo separate.Dev finally breaks off his marriage and becomes poor and makes a living by\npainting and as for Priya she doesn't have the heart to break to break off\nher marriage but afterwards he finds out and is fine with it and he helps\nher get ready for valentine's day. When the day comes the two are on their\nway but something happens to Priya...........Mann is good dispite it was a flop in India i think i may be wrong but i\nthink it was. Mann deserves a 9.9 out of 10.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Mann (1999)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nMusic Copied...!!!\nIndus_Bull\nCOPY!!!!\nrheaisgreat\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nHum Aapke Hain Koun...!\nHungama\nRehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein\nKhushi\nAkele Hum Akele Tum\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

It's like Joe\nEszterhas picked up his old \"Basic Instinct\" script and simply started\nchanging some of the characters names and added or changed just some\nfew situations. They pathetically tried to surprise the audience with\nsome plot twist that you could see from miles away. Halfway trough the\nmovie I already knew who the person was they were chasing. That means\neither two things; I'm smart or the writer is just stupid, I think that\nthe second one sounds more probable. And what was with the final plot\ntwist at the end? That really didn't made sense as did the entire movie\nthat was just filled with some major plot holes.Also the style was very incoherent. Only the second half of the movie\nthe movie gets a nice visual style with some good camera-work. Still the movie is perfectly watchable for one simple reason; The car\nchases. The car chases and crashes are really spectacular like you\ncould expect from director William Friedkin, the guy who brought us\n\"The French Connection\". Although it is a bit strange that no matter\nhow hard the cars crash into thing, in the next shot the car always\nlooks tip-top again.Watchable but most certainly not recommendable soft-erotic/thriller.5/10\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Jade (1995)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nFriedkin the true writer?WTF\nmp989\nSubliminal images and messages?\nsojiroseta52\nWIDESCREEN VERSION\nthx11384eb\nDid anyone really liked it?\nartemiss_84\nDifferent versions, aspect ratio, lousy dvdetc Help\nmp989\nAngie Everhart\nladyorthetygr\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nBasic Instinct\nThe Last Seduction\nMagnum Force\nBody Heat\nPresumed Innocent\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Thomas Howell, one of my favourite 80's stars, does not look good in\nthis movie I have to admit. At times he looked more like a strangulated\nJim Carrey doing one of his goofy faces. His acting was not the best I\nhave to admit, although I have to say in his defence that the story was\nquite preposterous at points (especially the whole idea of him just\njumping in his BMW and tootling down to the wrong side of the tracks to\nfind out answers!)Sean Young is of very little consequence really. Aside from looking\ngood (and naked for about .05 of a second) she is ignored on the whole.DeeDee Pfeiffer's role could have been expanded but as it is was left\npretty two dimensional.As for Ben Browder, his was actually quite a pivotal role and aided the\nstory twists, but again was under utilised.I have to say the worst culprit of the whole movie was the story. It\nwas very slow in places dragging its feet over unnecessary elements and\nthen suddenly making great leaps across other plot features. However, even though it was no \"Usual Suspects\" (the only film in\ncreation to keep me guessing until the last second, no mean feat I can\ntell you) it had some nice twists and the ending was explained well (I\nhate half-endings).Overall, if I saw this coming on TV I would watch it again, and I feel\nthat I have made a worthwhile (if a little frivolous) purchase from\nAmazon.My final two thoughts are:Firstly, re: the extras on the DVD, DON'T bother with the deleted\nscenes and DO listen to what Brad and Ben say in their interview! They\ntell you NOT to watch the interview before the movie as they give away\na MAJOR plot feature (I did not heed their advice and so fell foul of\nthis fact!)and secondly, it is so strange to hear Ben swear. Never could quite get\nused to it :-)\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for A Killer Within (2004)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nWorst movie Ever\nchivas480\nInterpreting 2 sentences\nPiranianRose\n****spoiler*** Dr Pepper\nroger565\nwhos that girl durin the vargas interrogation scene??\nmaximuz20032003\nThe magnets\nbiohazard12589\nAnyone Know Anything About this Movie?\nthehistorymajor\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nEntre las piernas\nIn Pursuit\nPretty Persuasion\nSacrifice\nAffliction\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

The drug king's top security man, Mike Marshak (Sam Elliott), takes a\nshine to Rita, although we aren't sure why. I spent the entire film thinking\nhe might be an undercover cop -not so. Had it been any other actor besides\nElliott I think this flaw might have prevented the film from being\nbelievable. But Elliott, and his cool, understated style just swept me away\nwith his obvious attraction to Rita.

I thought it was to be\nsomething like Clockwork Orange's 'ultraviolent' Beethoven groovin\ncharacter. Auf dem Gegenteil! Instead, I was strait-jacked to my\ntheater seat with a ball gag and shown --- love.The director 'has you\nat hello' with his mastery of inducing the vicarious experience of\nbeing judge, jury and executioner. While at first, I wanted to serve\nmerely as a lawmaker/enforcer, it later began to dawn on my oh so thick\nskull, that here was a stereogram of love. You look at a stereogram and\nat first see nothing to justify further indulgence. Then you keep on\nlooking anyway and get your reward. OASIS reward for looking into the\nprivate lives of the two lead characters is knowing once and for all:\nthe meaning of love.

Dean Cain stars\nas Max Hooper who makes Mission Impossible-type capers look easy. This\nmovie has as much fun as \"Lethal Weapon\" and as much drama as \"Die\nHard.\" Add that to the suspense in \"Towering Inferno\" and you have the\nrecipe for a top-notch disaster film. A corrupt executive schedules in\nimpromptu meeting in his office with his colleagues; unbeknownst to\nhim, Max Hooper is in the building trying to steal a valuable computer\nchip, his wife & her lawyer show up to give him divorce papers, and\nsomeone in his company is attempting to ruin him, and in the process,\nstarts a fire.But who is behind what? And why? There are surprises at every turn, and\nkeeps you riveted until the end.

Add the first question.\n(Comment on this title)\n3 out of 5 people found the following comment useful:-\nTroubling but Timely, 1 February 2005\nAuthor:\neht5y from United States\nThe Weatherman faction remains one of the more troubling aspects of the\n60s counterculture, for manifold reasons. How did a bunch of\nwell-educated, relatively privileged white kids transform from\nidealistic protesters for peace into revolutionary terrorists? How were\nthey able to reconcile the inherent contradiction of using violence as\na means of pursuing peace? Can violence ever lead to reconciliation, or\nmust it necessarily beget more violence? Sam Green and Bill Siegel's\ndocumentary examines all of these questions while remaining remarkably\nobjective. It's a pity that we should feel surprised when a documentary\nfilmmaker actually attempts to uphold the all-but-obsolete standard of\nobjectivity; nevertheless, Green and Siegel deserve to be complimented\nfor presenting a film that is perhaps more a window into the confusion\nof the times than a history of one peculiar faction of anti-government\nactivists.Green & Siegel intersperse archival footage with commentary by a number\nof the Weather Underground's leaders, most of whom retain their\nrevolutionary idealism, even if they have grown circumspect about their\nmethodology.The film persuasively channels the aura of violence and political\nunrest that characterized American culture as the first vestiges of\ncounter-cultural idealism gave way first to frustration as the war in\nVietnam escalated and then to radicalism as, one after another, civil\nand human rights activists ranging from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to\nChicago Black Panther leader Fred Hampton were brutally silenced,\npossibly by order of American government agencies such as the CIA, NSA,\nand FBI. Simultaneously, the tenor of apolitical American life shifted\nfrom the good vibrations of psychedelia to paranoia and suspicion. The\nimage of the blissed-out, peace-loving, groovy hippie was replaced by\nthe crazed expression of Charles Manson, whose murderous id made every\nGod-fearing citizen's worst nightmares reality: acid-crazed hippies\nrampaging the suburbs, butchering innocents in order to start a\nrevolution that would overthrow the status quo. Siegel's and Green's\ndirection employs numerous archival clips that are shockingly graphic,\nincluding horrific footage of executions and the bodies of civilian\ncasualties in Vietnam (including many women and small children) and\nuncensored crime scene photographs from the Tate-LaBianca murders\nordered by Charles Manson. The material is somewhat objectionable, but\nserves the purpose of expressing the climate of fear that made it\npossible for the likes of Mark Rudd--now a quiet, somewhat melancholy\nmath teacher at a community college in New Mexico--to drop out of sight\nand begin plotting the violent overthrow of the American political\nsystem.The film presents the Weather Underground as admirable in its courage\nand determination, but also as terminally misguided. Weatherman leaders\nrepeatedly express their solidarity with the Black Panthers and any\nrevolutionary movement of underclass 'brown or black' people on the\nplanet, but the few Panthers who comment for the film either disavow\nthe Weathermen or express perplexity at their determination to identify\nwith the struggle of blacks and other oppressed ethnicities. As adults,\nseveral of the group members acknowledge that, even when they were\nharassed or beaten by police, they were still treated far more humanely\nthan their black counterparts, and so were never truly in the same\nstruggle as those whom they supported. Some of the members still speak\nnostalgically about their Weathermen days and claim that they'd do it\nall over again; others express disdain and regret over their complicity\nin the deaths of innocents.As we begin to see history repeating itself in Iraq, 'The Weather\nUnderground' is all too timely. What was different about the 60s and\n70s, when so many young people became committed to political activism,\nfrom the present, when the numbers are relatively few? Will the process\nthat brought about the Weather Underground repeat itself, or was this\nparticular group less a consequence of the times than of the choices of\na few charismatic but misguided and naive twenty-somethings? Did\nWeatherman make a difference, or was it simply another small piece of\nthe catastrophic collage of the Vietnam era? This film raises more\nquestions than it answers--which is probably what art should always try\nto do.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for The Weather Underground (2002)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nDid they really support Charlie Manson??\ndododadadodo\nwere the weathermen right?\nthinkingmachine\nthe weather man were LOSERS\nwrensalert\nDig this\nhoobler878\nwhere is today's SDS\npepsivanilla\nAnother song question -slide guitar\nadamrl-1\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nUnderground\nNeverland: The Rise and Fall of the Symbionese Liberation Army\nPunishment Park\nIn the Year of the Pig\nMedium Cool\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

But SE7EN it ain't..., 15 April 2004\nAuthor:\nFreedomisanillusion from Tasmania, Australia\nDespite my love of Angelina Jolie, I must say that Taking Lives wasted\na lot of good opportunity.Given that they invented an entirely new lead character, we can't\nreally compare this to the book, so let's look at it as a movie of it's\nown right.Jolie plays Illeana Scott, a somewhat strange FBI agent who is called\nup to Canada to investigate the grisly murders of several young men,\nall whom have had their identities stolen by the killer. New to the\nscene is witness James Costa, Ethan Hawke, who soon grows to have an\nattachment to Scott.At turns formulaic and down right rip off (the credits are far too\nsimilar to be called a homage to SE7EN), Taking Lives is a very\nenjoyable piece of work.Beautifully shot, the film wallows in its moods. It knows that it can\nbe creepy, but it wears it out on its sleeves.Angelina is on top form as Scott, although its a shame that the movie\ndoes stoop to the need for quick-sex-scene-with-unnecessary-titty-shot.Ethan Hawke is bearable as Costa, although he and Jolie have very\nlittle chemistry.Other players, Olivier Martinez, Gena Rowlands, Tcheky Karyo and Jean\nHughes-Angalade are also quite good.The film does have its highs: excellent cinematography, creepy sinister\nmood, two fantastic adrenaline-jump moments that I never saw coming.\nBut it also has one FATAL flaw, and that is that anyone who has seen\nany piece of film or television before will be able to guess who the\nkiller is. Still, a fun movie nevertheless.7/10 If you get the chance to see it in the cinema, watch people's\nreactions to the 'scissors-scene'. I was amazed to see hoe genuinely\nhorrified even the most hardened viewers in my cinema were.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Taking Lives (2004)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nwhy angelina didn't think Ethan wasn't the serial killers at first ?SPOI\nhonsheung18\nThe Poster\ntarmikosPnB\npaul dano?\nkayte_the_myspace_addict\nthe sexiest scene of Ang?\nhonsheung18\n'Love' Scene\nseewhatimesdone\nAm I the only one?????\nMasked_Superhero\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nSin City\nCopycat\nAmerican Psycho\nBasic Instinct\nIdentity\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Pure Awesome Power!\nSatchRules!\nSteve Vai & Eric Johnson are great players as well,but Joe has the big edge\nin my books. I wish there had have been more songs on the disc but what was\non it still makes up for an enjoyable concert of some of the best guitar\nplayers in the world today.\nFor all you \"Satch\" fans, check out his upcoming DVD release of \"Joe\nSatriani-Live In San Francisco\" coming out on Aug 21st 2001....It's going to\nbe nuts!\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for G3 Live in Concert (1996) (V)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nThe Last Waltz\nMy Generation\nWoodstock\nBruce Dickinson: Dive, Dive, Dive\nLive Aid\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

People do not know what LaGuardia HS\nis until I mention that it's the \"Fame\" school. In my four years of\nbeing a student there, I did not watch \"Fame\". In fact, I just saw it 4\ndays ago. There are two teachers from the movie that currently teach at\nLaGuardia, Penny Frank and Jim Moody.There were some things that did not connect, obviously. For instance,\nyou would never do pointe freshman year. It captured the student's\nspirits very well, however we never broke into song and dance during\nlunch, we were too busy eating!! Some people will have their\ninstruments and jam a bit in the lunchroom or senior lounge. In between\nbreaks, the dance majors are still in their leotards grabbing lunch.\nMusic majors have blackout days, where they come into school directly\ninto the concert hall and not class and rehearse all day. What I do\nmiss about the school is seeing people cut class to hang out in the\nhallway and work on their harmonies. Figuring out math problems while\ndown the hall, a class would be studying their new Italian aria.I did not feel as if the movie was amazing. In terms of capturing the\nspirit of the students, it was incredible. The struggles that all the\nstudents went through was definitely a reality. There were many things\nleft out in the movie, especially the endings of various situations\nbetween the students.I miss LaGuardia though. Never will I go to a school like that with\npeople as interesting. I'm in college now and haven't really found\npeople interesting enough to stimulate my mind. I am proud to be a\ngraduate of the Fame school, for it was the best four years of my life.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Fame (1980)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nThe Play- Fame on stage!!\nDarkPrincess1989\nappropriate?\nhazelnutty73\nFame Part Two\nCamelot_2000\nFavorite Scene\nmaggiemoon83\nThe Musical Script?\nphiil24\nMeg Tilly\nWilde_child\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nAmerican Beauty\nOnce Upon a Time in America\nEllie Parker\nWinter Passing\nAll That Jazz\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

An unusual film, at least for its time. A\nstylish film full of cool dialog, cinematography, editing and music.\nThe whole thing comes together perfectly and is very short of creating\na sublime film experience. The plot is excellently written and told.\nThe pace is perfect. I wasn't bored for a second, nor did I ever really\nwant it to move faster or slower. The cinematography is magnificent,\nand incredibly well-integrated. Pans, dolly trips and, lest we forget,\nthe stationary shots... all perfectly used. Very stylized. The acting\nis top-notch all-round. With most of the cast being name actors, this\nis no surprise, but they really do shine. Madsen, Buscemi, Keitel,\nRoth... all incredible. The one role that had less than good... well,\nlet's be honest, it had rather awful acting. I'm speaking, of course,\nof Tarantino's character. Now, don't get me wrong; in From Dusk Till\nDawn, this man did great. But just about any other time I've seen him\nact, he just doesn't seem to have the first clue. Being a film-maker\nmyself(albeit on somewhat of a smaller scale than Quentin), I can\nrelate to wanting to cast yourself in a role... but sometimes, you just\nneed to face up to the facts, and admit it if you can't act. Still,\nthat is a minor complaint. Another one might be that there are at least\ntwo fairly big characters that seem completely and entirely\nexpendable... they had no real role in the action and could very, very\neasily have been cut with no real loss to the overall product. I won't\nname them here, but anyone who's seen the film will know who I'm\ntalking about. All the characters, however, are well-written and their\nactions credible. Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to writing...\nsomething that also shows in the dialog, which, although somewhat\ndrawn-out at times, is exceptional. Well-delivered, too. When it comes\nto direction, he shows how talented he is, as well. The film is very\nwell put together. The editing is great, with the non-linear time-line\ntelling the story far better than a \"regular\" film ever could. One of\nthe many Tarantino-fans, in fact, the very person who originally talked\nme into watching this film, once told me that he had heard of someone\nediting films with such time-lines - this, Pulp Fiction, Memento, etc.\n- so that their time-lines were perfectly linear. I'm sorry, I entirely\nrespect their right to do such a thing... and I won't claim that their\ndoing so has less artistic value than the original films in any way...\nbut I refuse to watch that. A big part of this being so well-told lies\nin the time-line. Also, I'm a firm believer of watching something the\nway the makers intended it. Don't edit, don't censor, don't make your\nown version and pass it off as anything but just that... your own\nversion, and not the original. Sorry, rant over. Finally, I just need\nto comment on the music... the soundtrack of this is just great.\nTarantino collected so many amazing 70's tunes for this film and used\nthem great. All in all, just a really, really good film. Very little\nkeeps this from being a perfect ten, most of which I've covered here. I\nrecommend this to anyone who can stomach the violence and who likes\ntheir films with a side of style. 8/10\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Reservoir Dogs (1992)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nAlternate themes?\nShepherd_Soccer\nOpening scene\njmmycsnv\nThe balloon SPOILER\nSteve_Kaczynski\nWhite whispers something to Orange?\ndonmichaelK\nQuestion (Spoilers)\nelmexicano508\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nPulp Fiction\nThe Departed\nCidade de Deus\nScarface\nKill Bill: Vol. 1\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

One of the most atmospheric movies I've\never seen, fresh and worthy of remembrance. No, it's no action, it's\neven somewhat slow. Out of all standards, sometimes it even looks like\na sort of a video-clip put to the majestic (not bombastic!) symphonic\nmusic of Rob Simonsen. Despite of a plenty of dramatic moments the film\nstill leaves a good trace. The story looks really like a part of the\nmain character's life, not just a story written by an author:\ncharacters appear and disappear playing their roles in the spiritual\nquest of the hero, the hero moves to his ghost-like aim haunted by the\nmemories of his recently lost love, analyzing his chivalrous past and\nfinding himself on the rediscovered path of honour. A little-known gem.\nHardly believable that someone is still able to make such movies in\n2003. 10 out of 10.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Westender (2003)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\n:) . . .i luv it- yea canada. . . :)\nlitesneeze-1\nThe Worst Movie ever\nmarvsan2000\nQUESTION\nyum_a_cookie\nProduction company Comments\nbbrown2676\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nMerlin\nThe Phantom of the Opera\nTimeline\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\nTristan + Isolde\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Now, the sequel to the hit is about\nCrysta, of course, and all of her friends. First it's all happy and\neverything. Everyone in FernGully is having a high-ol'-time. But then\nsomething happens...Two poachers (\"Boss\" and Mac) come to the woods with two dogs. The two\nthen kidnap the poor baby animals and take them to the circus. On the way\nout of the forest, they also manage to burn it down. Now, busy with\nregrowing trees, FernGully puts the fetching of the animals job on the\nshoulders of Pips and his gang, along with Batty Koda.Anyways, I was watching this the other night out of boredom, and even\nlaughed some. I think it is a good sequel that lives up to the first\nFernGully and encourage parents to buy it for their children to add to\ntheir\nmovie collection.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for FernGully 2: The Magical Rescue (1998) (V)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nhow come...\nLittle_devil394\nferngully story\nYgGrasshopper\nThe Song..\nlilcutiewitabootie_08\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nToy Story 2\nThe Lion King II: Simba's Pride\nReturn to Never Land\nStitch!

I\nhad high hopes for Hypercube but i didn't expect it to be as good or better\nthan the first. I think people would enjoy it more if they didn't expect\nunreasonable expectations for this one.Hypercube has some flaws, but it is still entertaining. If you love Science\nand Physics (like i do), then you will love some of the questions this film\nproposes.I liked the darker feel of the first film more so than Hypercube. The\n\"Cubes\" in this one are basically very bright white and it is sometimes very\nintrusive to the eyes. I also would have liked less characters in this one.\nOne thing that worked so well in Cube 1 were the interesting characters and\nthe fact that there were not many in the film at all. This doesn't always\nwork in most films, but it worked perfectly in Cube 1.If there was one thing which i really did not like in Hypercube, it would\nhave to be the ending. It was very cheesy and way over the top. It seemed\nlike an episode of The X Files, which works just fine for a Sci-fi TV\nseries, but it just didn't work here.So, is Hypercube worth viewing? Yes it is, simply because some viewers will\nlike it more than others. It is still a better movie than most of the Sci-fi\nmovies that have been released lately. If you love the original Cube you\nshould check out Hypercube, if only to watch it one time...\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Cube 2: Hypercube (2002)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nwhat a dumb dang piece of crap\nroyl-1\nA cube in the 4th demension???\nqwshadow\nWorst movie in the history of film\nbernerdawg\nWhy Simon wouldn't be able to kill Sasha...\nmsirois89\nim sorry..the endning???\nmjustinvirly\ntraps\nwheelzthatkeelz\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nCube\nHollow Man II\nSaw III\nTaking Lives\nCube Zero\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Good actors. Sweet tone. Inventive\nbits\nthat echo the spirit of the previous movie. However, I agree with Leonard\nMaltin on the one flaw: no story. This movie is more or less a collections\nof vignettes, sometimes with little to no connection with each other. If\nthere had been a developing story to hang these vignettes on, we would\nhave\ngotten a movie very close to the quality of the previous movie. But as it\nis\nnow, it's a simple pleasant movie.

Add the first question.\n(Comment on this title)\nNever see this, 23 March 2007\nAuthor:\nwolfecastle86 from United States\nLet me start off by saying I love Blue Seed. On many occasions, I have\nwatched the entire show in one sitting. So when I found out ADV was\ngoing to release Blue Seed Beyond, I was pretty dang excited. But all\nthat changed when I rented this. First of all, the animation quality is\nTERRIBLE. It resembles the TV show in no way. It was animated the new\nway with a computer, but it actually looks worse than the TV series.\nSecondly, the story is lousy. Two episodes is way too short to revive\nan enemy that they fought for 26 episodes, and moving it to America\nmade it even worse because part of the charm of the original was it was\na Japanese legend. All the are characters back, but they do not act the\nsame and they are almost aren't even used in the story. The villain is\nlaughably bad, and if you watch the dubbed version, you won't even find\nit funny but unbearable. And to add insult to injury, they throw in a\nthird episode that has nothing to do with the series. It involves a\nterrorist planting a bomb in a hot spring where the characters are, and\nif the level of the water changes, it goes off. It seemed like a rip\noff of Burn Up, and had nothing to do with Blue Seed. It wasn't funny,\nit wasn't dramatic, and even the fan service (which they obviously\nwrote the episode for) wasn't good or interesting. Even though I pride\nmyself on not being a troll or arguing with trolls, I honestly cannot\nsay enough bad things about this OAV. Just rewatch all your old blue\nseed tapes and do not even think about this, for it might as well not\nexist.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Aokushimitama blue seed 2 (1997)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nRakusho!

The film made me feel like a\nfool because I couldn't make head nor tail of the serpentine plot and\nthe nonsensical characters. But I felt kind of embarrassed to admit to\nmyself that the film was tying my brain up in knots. So I stuck with it\nto the end, hoping that the whole tangled mess would untangle itself.\nThen I realised.... the film is SUPPOSED to be serpentine, nonsensical\nand illogical, because that's the whole point. This is a satirical look\nat conspiracy theories and theorists, with the knotting-up of the plot\nused as a metaphor for the knotting-up of truths, half-truths and lies\nthat define any conspiracy. Even when I got that the joke was on me, I\nstill felt Winter Kills to be a pretty awful movie.Young Nick Kegan (Jeff Bridges) is the younger brother of a former\nUnited States President who was assassinated in Philadelphia. Nick is\npresent when a dying man claims that he shot the President and gives\ndetailed information about where he hid the gun. Nick follows the\nclues, but every step of the way the people helping him seem to die in\nmysterious circumstances. Also, his father Pa Kegan (John Huston), a\nvulgar and disgustingly wealthy businessman, keeps interfering with\nNick's investigation. The deeper he delves into the assassination, the\nmore Nick realises that he is descending into a web of complex lies and\nred herrings, where nothing is as it seems and no-one can be trusted.The film is an utter nightmare to follow, and in many ways is not worth\ntrying to follow for the afore-mentioned reason that it deliberately\ntangles itself up. The cast is packed with extraordinary talent but\nmost of them are wasted. Toshiro Mifune has one of the briefest and\nmost pointless cameo roles in cinematic history; Elizabeth Taylor\nappears uncredited and has not a single line of dialogue; Richard Boone\nis given what seems to be an interesting role but his character goes\nnowhere. John Huston has the best role as the powerful patriarch and\nprovides us with the film's few enjoyable moments with his acerbic\ndelivery. Anthony Perkins also gets a creepy role and handles it well,\nthough his screen time is far too short to do complete justice to the\ncharacter. Some nudity and sex scenes are tossed in for no real reason\nand, while they're quite graphic and might appeal to voyeurs, they\nreally belong in another film. The film's semi-comic climax is farcical\nand disappointing, yet paradoxically memorable in its weird little way.\nThere's obviously a cult audience out there somewhere for Winter\nKills.... but I won't be counting myself among its number.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Winter Kills (1979)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nWhata Cast\necarle\nWhat really happened to this movie?\nukkid35\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nWag the Dog\nThe Second Civil War\nBeing There\nMan of the Year\nJFK\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

TIT)\" and it seems like a perfect\nplace to have campus life with booze, hot chicks who wear bikinis, and\nbeing yourself. However a scientist named Professor Holt ( Lisa Gaye)\nhas been creating humanoid beings out of chemicals called Sub-Humanoids\nwho are perfect for slavery, pleasure and to serve people but however\nthey are different than the average normal human being as they have\nsecond mouths for bellybuttons and they would sometimes go into\nmeltdown into slimy gooey little creatures if they hurt people. Ace\nreporter Roger Smith ( Brick Bronsky) is on the verge to find out about\nthe secret of who is behind these sub-humanoids even if he falls for\none.Weak but fun sequel to the 1986 cult trash classic from Troma with the\nusual knockers, self referential material, nudity, and gross out humor\nwith it. I did however thought that girl Roger falls for is a total\nhottie even though her character had a mouth on her stomach, if your in\nthe mood for goofy no-brain fun then watch this if you liked the\noriginal.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Class of Nuke 'Em High Part II: Subhumanoid Meltdown (1991)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nClass of Nuke 'Em High 3: The Good, the Bad and the Subhumanoid\nClass of Nuke 'Em High\nThe Toxic Avenger, Part II\nPorky's Revenge\nThe Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

As one character\nplotzes: \"When did eating out become theater?\" The wonderful, winsome multi-ethnic ensemble of mostly New York actors\n--many born in Brooklyn according to the IMDb--who have done a lot of\nTV work are clearly enjoying making a movie as a coordinated team.\nDanny Aiello has his best, and somewhat similar, role since \"City\nHall.\" Many of the references may go over the heads of those West of the\nHudson or East of the East River, whether to Tribeca (as a newly trendy\nneighborhood) or Danny Meyer (restaurant entrepreneur). Or even the\ndigs at Queens as the home of mobsters, which were greeted by silence\nby the Queens audience I saw it with.The upstairs/downstairs of the kitchen scrambles vs. the dining\npleasures and everyone's personal spices are lots of fun. The actors\nplaying obnoxious customers, like Sandra Bernhard, do so with relish\nbut not overplayed.Keep your palate clear by not looking at the ad campaign or reading the\nreviews, as I think they give the plot away and I was totally surprised\nby the ending, er, the dessert.(originally written 9/29/2001)\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Dinner Rush (2000)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nBest character in movie\nneilsugg\nWhat's the game they're playing?\nentropy-10\nsound problems?\nfred-49\nbathroom hit song\nbluegrassish\nWho did the music for this movie?\nbiodmed\nworth buying?\nLunarJunk89\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nFly Away Baby\nIt's Always Fair Weather\nGoodfellas\nA Man Betrayed\nEast Side Kids\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Comedy Central had to pull the show from its 2005 schedule leaving the future of the show uncertain. The network decided to shelve the completed sketches hoping Chappelle would eventually return to finish the season. After Chappelle publicly announced that he had no intention of returning to the show, Comedy Central decided to repackage some of the completed sketches and air them in 2006. The sketches were presented minus the introductory wraparounds Chappelle used to do as host as those segments had not been taped before Chappelle left. Charles Q. Murphy and Donnell Rawlings took over the hosting duties.\nmore\nGoofs:\nContinuity: In the third \"When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong\" skit, Brenda's last name changes from Johnston to Rounds.\nmore\nQuotes:\nUnknown Soldier:\n[dying] I could do with some sex!\nmore\nMovie Connections:\nFeatured in Last Laugh '05 (2005) (TV)\nmore\nSoundtrack:\nHip-Hop\nmore\nWhat is the name of the song that plays during the \"Blackzilla\" sketch?\nWhat is the song that plays while Dave steps out on stage?\nI heard that Clayton Bigsby was based on Dave's grandfather?

Dave is the\nfunniest thing on tv hands down. Comedy Central knows it and apparently\neveryone but one user on here knows it too. The Charlie Murphy episodes\nare\nbrilliant. However, the 'Wayne Brady' skit was one of the most funniest\nskits I've ever seen in my lifetime. I got to work the next day and the\nentire department was quoting from it. It's been a while for a comedy show\nto come along and have such an impact on 'all of us'. I'm looking forward\nto\nthe third season.

Add the first question.\n(Comment on this title)\n2 out of 2 people found the following comment useful:-\nVirtuoso performance, 21 April 2002\nAuthor:\nDuncan Gowers from London, United Kingdom\n\"The Song Remains The Same\" is essentially a film of a concert, yet thanks\nto the drug and ego-addled personalities of Led Zeppelin in the mid-1970s,\nthe footage is fleshed out to include weird 'fantasy' sequences involving\neach of the four band members.While this section of the movie leaves a\nlittle to be desired, the concert footage is truly breathtaking, capturing\nthe greatest hard rock band in history at their apogee.The film opens with an odd gangster-style sequence, where faceless mobsters\nare mowed down by what would appear to be rival gangsters.Whatever meaning\nthis scene is meant to represent is not clear, however it has been suggested\nthat the faceless mobsters are the British press, who had vilified Led\nZeppelin through their entire career.Who knows, but it certainly makes for\nan interesting start to the film.From there the film takes an interesting turn.Each individual band member\nis introduced.We see drummer John Bonham ploughing his fields in a\ntractor, bassist John Paul Jones reading nursery rhymes to his children,\nsinger Robert Plant playing with his wife and children in an English country\nlake (the scene resembles the cover of Led Zeppelin's 1973 album 'Houses of\nthe Holy'), while guitarist Jimmy Page is introduced next to a riverside.\nThey each receive a letter informing them that they are to tour the next\nday.Once Led Zeppelin take the stage at New York's Madison Square Garden, the\naction really begins.The band run through some of their absolute classics,\nincluding 'Whole Lotta Love', 'Stairway to Heaven', 'Heartbreaker' and a\nmassive version of 'Dazed and Confused'.The quality of musicianship is\namazing.Page's guitar playing belies belief and John Bonham's twenty\nminute drum solo is awe inspiring.As the band plays there are more fantasy\nscenes, the best of which includes Robert Plant as some kind of Arthurian\nhero.The way in which Led Zeppelin embrace and play on the Tolkien-like\nworld of mystical fantasy is truly refreshing in these over-stylised days,\nwhere musicians are more concerned with the amount of gel in their hair than\nthe music they produce.Watching the band at work you get a distinct feeling that the musicians of\ntoday really aren't as proficient as they were twenty or thirty years ago.\nLed Zeppelin it seems were better live than on record, which would be\nunheard of today.As an audience we are able to see \"The Song Remains The Same\" for what it\nis: a timepiece.Post-1975, Led Zeppelin's work became gradually lower in\nquality and as Punk revolutionised the music scene, they became dinosaurs at\nthe end of the decade.But in this time, their 1971-1975 period, Led\nZeppelin were the biggest band in the world, and their power is captured\nwith brilliant clarity on this film.Whatever happened after this time is a\nmoot point; this is how Led Zeppelin should and will be remembered.A must\nfor any serious music fan.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for The Song Remains the Same (1976)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nFave Zep Song!!!!!

Add the first question.\n(Comment on this title)\n1 out of 1 people found the following comment useful:-\nTwo or Three Things He Knows -Godard's long goodbye continues with a meditation on war and a history of the cinema, 11 February 2007\nAuthor:\napwbd154 from United States\nNotre Musique is the latest, but scarcely the least, of Jean-Luc\nGodard's elegies for 20th-century Europe, the cinema, and himself.\nOlympian in its detachment, the movie is heartfelt in a desire to\nacknowledge the Other\u2014as its guardian angel.Unlike Godard's last film, In Praise of Love, Notre Musique searches,\nif not for cosmic harmony, then for some sort of secular redemption.\nHas our irascible JLG been reconciled? The 73-year-old director's\nserene meditation on Europe's landscape after battle has an unusually\nobvious triptych structure, with each panel (or act) named for one of\nDante's three \"kingdoms.\" The central, hour-long \"Purgatory\" of a\nwriters' conference in Sarajevo bridges the opening 10-minute \"Hell\"\nand a concluding 10-minute \"Heaven.\" \"Hell\" is a sensationally edited\nfound-footage montage that yokes together clips from newsreels and all\nmanner of movies (Alexander Nevsky, Fort Apache, and Kiss Me Deadly).\nAre these images real? Drawing on the video layering techniques\ndeveloped in his magisterial Histoire(s) du Cin\u00e9ma, this distressed,\nbleeding assemblage is something like Godard's bid for a Guernica\u2014a\nvisceral and formally brilliant evocation of total war.As in Dante, Hell is a tough act to follow. \"Reporters always visit the\nhells, and tourists the paradises! One seldom goes to purgatory,\"\nGodard told. But Sarajevo is a former hell that attracts a particular\nkind of tourist. JLG appears as his rumpled self to give a talk at a\nFrench-sponsored literary conference; other participants include\nSpanish novelist Juan Goytisolo, Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish, and\na fictional Israeli journalist (Sarah Adler) carrying a copy of\nLevinas's Entre Nous. Like him, she's concerned with building bridges.\nSo is Godard, although his mainly have to do with metaphor and montage.Despite the absence of Bosnian-speaking subjects, Notre Musique takes\nas its ruling metaphor Mostar's Stari Most, the stone bridge that\noutlived the Ottomans and withstood two world wars until it was\npulverized by Croatian artillery in 1993. But Bosnia mostly serves as a\nbackdrop for the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, or Jews\nand themselves. Godard's translator, the son of a Jewish-Egyptian\nCommunist, has come to Sarajevo to meet his Israeli niece Olga (Nade\nDieu). Not only named for but sounding like a 19th-century Russian\nheroine, she tells him (in French) that she's contemplating a form of\nsuicide to protest the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank.The heart of the movie is Godard's lecture (a disquisition on the\nethics of montage) and its failure: Hilariously uncertain that he has\nmade his point regarding the (mis-)recognition of the Other, he\norchestrates a pan across his expressionless audience. Olga, offscreen,\nasks how DV mini-cameras might affect the future of cinema. Godard\nstares impassively for a long minute. The oracle is speechless,\nalthough Notre Musique, it should be noted, is shot largely in 35mm and\ncharacterized by an austere, Calvinist beauty. The colors are saturated\nand the contrast pronounced, with figures typically silhouetted against\na bright background. The editing is dense. A second viewing shows Olga\nrepeatedly glimpsed on the streets of Sarajevo.However madly aphoristic, filled with close-ups, and populated by\nserious young women, this is one of Godard's more documentary films;\ngiven his programmatic perversity, he keeps stressing the importance of\nfiction, fable, and icon. The haunting final movement takes\nself-martyred Olga to a paradise that, despite the presence of U.S.\nMarines, strongly resembles the same Swiss landscape where Godard shot\nhis last meditation on the Balkan wars, For Ever Mozart.Too touchy-feely for some hardcore Godardians, Notre Musique is the\nmost lucid of the master's recent films. More gnarly Godard may be\nfound in Moments Choisis des Histoire(s) du Cin\u00e9ma. An 85-minute\ndistillation of his fin de si\u00e8cle magnum opus, the five-hour,\neight-part video Histoire(s) du Cin\u00e9ma, the heavily encoded Moments is\nanother installation in Godard's long goodbye. The artist merges film\nand video as well as painting and cinema. Earnest stars rush the camera\namid a flickering thaumascope effect. Moments might be an Oscar-night\nclip-fest doc transmitted from an unknown galaxy.Not half a dozen men\nhave ever been able to keep the whole equation of pictures in their\nheads. Godard is one of them.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Notre musique (2004)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nmeaning of the title ?\nbettinay-1\ngodard discussion group\ngloria.monti\nMusic in Musique\njnhiller2003\nPictures from Heaven section\nzikanov\nPan + Scan DVD?\nGabrielValley\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\n11'09''01 - September 11\nThe Beach\nThe Mambo Kings\nBenny's Video\nGuerreros\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

This film, however, is just a\njoke to try and entertain children with a watered-down, lighthearted\ncomedy movie that fails to be original or entertaining. The animation\nis crap, the plot line is simple enough to bore you to death, and the\nvillain is not even a fraction of the greatness Frollo was. All the\nvillain is after is a stupid bell, how boring is that? The characters\naren't even that likable, even Esmeralda, Phoebus, and Quasi don't\nshare the same spark of personality they had in the first film. They're\nbasically cardboard cutout characters. The songs are annoying and guess\nwhat? The may have killed off Frollo, one of the deepest villains in\nDisney history, but at least they still have the cute gargoyle\nsidekicks! (shoot me now.)

But as i work in blockbusters, i\nget free rentals every week so thought i might as well rent it out.\nMan, was i in for a shocker!! Talk about totally hilarious.Some of the gags in this film were quality - Robin Williams is at his\ncomical best. I'm not saying it's Williams' best ever film (cough good\nwill hunting cough) but certainly he's never been this funny. His gag\nabout the abnormally shaped cookie was so funny. In fact, i've never\nlaughed this much since Dumb and Dumber.Edward Norton was actually very believable as the clean cut good guy. I\ndidn't expect it from him after watching Fight club and American\nhistory X but he carried out his role really well.Catherine Keener also looked really beautiful, she played her\npower-hungry turned nice chick character to a tee.Even though the story is about a kids show, there's a lot of dark\ncomedy in it e.g. the involvement of the Irish gangsters (by the way\nalso very funny) showing what a good job Danny devito has done\ndirecting this film. Credit to him. All the characters in the film\nserved a purpose and above all, did it well!! All seemed believable and\nRobin Williams was the star.If you watch this film, persevere for the first 20 minutes because\nafter which the jokes and plot come in hard and thick.Top stuff, rent if you want a comedy with original storyline and a\nlittle bit of good humoured smut thrown in for good measure.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Death to Smoochy (2002)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nONE OF THE WORST MOVIES OF ALL TIME\nwolver12345\nYahoogroups new Edward Norton group!\nIamTammyP\n'Hard Times for Haggis?'

And even if one\nhas seen the series they still might not get all of this, but that's\nthe beauty of Anno's masterpiece Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of\nEvangelion. This alternate ending to the series was released after fans\ncomplained about the series original ending. If you've seen the\noriginal ending you already know that the actual \"ending\" analyzes the\ncharacters Shinji, Rei, Asuka, and Misato. While episode 26 of the\noriginal series is a complete fixation on Shinji, everything that\nhappens in that episode still happens to him in the last part of this.\nOnly his decision reverses. This shows a much more dramatic and\nextended version of Episodes 25 and 26 however, and answers a lot of\nthe questions that were left at the end of the series and does a great\njob generating new ones.

I wanted more\nof\nthe same kind of entertainment. This movie was very disappointing. It\nseems\nto happen a lot with me in terms of Hong Kong movies; I run into a great\none, then when I look into the other movies the star and/or director\nmade,\n90% of them suck.The movie starts off getting me excited, with Stephen Chow in a prison.\nThen\nit goes to this other guy for the next ten or so minutes straight and\nRUINS\nthe entire experience. Its the kind of movie you start watching leaning\nforward, but soon have your hand on your chin in boredom. This is about\n1%\nof the entertainment value of Shaolin Soccer. This other guy, Nick\nsomething, has no talent and has no ability to entertain. I think he's\npretty popular over in Asia, but outside the area and all the hype, where\nwe\njust see him as an actor, it is easy to tell how much he\nsucks.What's the matter with the script. It just cuts back and forth from\nrandom\nscene to random scene, and all of it is boring! If you want to make a\nrandom\nstyle movie, it can be extremely funny if done correctly. This was not.\nIT\nIS BORING. Why do many Asian films think they can do the same joke over\nand\nover for decades? Like the man running on the beach in slo-mo, Baywatch\nstyle. It was funny a million years ago when it was still\nnew.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Chin wong ji wong 2000 (1999)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nMr. Lucky\nSing si lip yan\nJeuk sing\nBai ga jai\nNgo dik yeh man tung hok\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Not to say that it isn't funny. It's\nabsolutely hilarious! But the main thing that appeals to me about Parenthood\nis the warm heart that is at the center of it all. These characters have\nnuanced, complicated, and not overly dramatic problems. Just like REAL\nPEOPLE, and unlike many of the one-faceted characters seen in movies\ntoday.And what better actor to play Gil than Steve Martin? A comedic genius,\nMartin is capable of playing anything from slimy to sincere, conforming\nperfectly to his role, and it helps that he's not a cynic. Also watch for\ngreat appearances by Tom Hulce, perhaps best known as Amadeus (poor guy,\nwhere'd his career go?) and a very young Joaquin Phoenix as\nGary.All in all, a very funny and very sweet comedy that I will give a\n9/10!!\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Parenthood (1989)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nNotice link to St. Louis + Missouri?\nserpno11\nGarry\nRowerChicka\nquestion\nwhenbersattack\nlost retainer\nsruddy2002\nZachary La Voy ....Justin Buckman\namyk479\nPicture pick-up goof!\nta421sbtrhalf\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nMrs. Doubtfire\nYours, Mine and Ours\nTerms of Endearment\nRiding in Cars with Boys\nLittle Miss Sunshine\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

They drive me up a wall. Same with\nromance books. But perhaps because this was romantic in a weird way, I\ndid really like it.Swain plays a down-and-out white trash girl in Virginia, married to a\ncreep named Edgar who robs stores to keep themselves afloat. They don't\ngive you a background as to why she ever married this creep, but the\nbloom has worn off the rose and she just wants to get away from him\nnow.She's in love with a very pale young man who is a lawyer in their small\nSouthern town. He's a big fish in a small pond and more to offer her\nthen she's ever seen in her whole white trash life.Edgar also has a best friend, a guy named \"Flowers\", for what reason I\ncan't imagine, who hangs around Edgar and his wife all the time.\nFlowers is infatuated with Inez, Edgar's wife, but she finds him\nrepulsive. He really is, at first--you have to look hard through all\nthe dirt and bad clothing and beard to recognize pretty nice-looking\nAri Verveen.Edgar knows Inez is in love with someone else and after a fight,\ndecides to keep her prisoner in her own house by chaining her to her\nbed at night and to the sofa daily, with Flowers standing guard while\nEdgar goes and does whatever it is he does.Inez manages to convince Flowers to help her to get away from Edgar by\nmurdering him for her. He doesn't really need a lot of convincing,\nsince he wants her for himself.These people are completely amoral and trashy, but there is still a\nbeautiful kind of poetic romance to Flower's love for Inez. I loved the\nmovie. Even if you hate romances, you may find it great too.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Briar Patch (2003)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nI have a doubt about flowers...\naracelis23\nHOT!!\notma1918\nStrange yet hypnotizing\ndixie_lowell\nInez's Lover\ntmo1909\nHow does that monolouge near the end go?!?!?!\nsteviequeen5106\nI love this movie!\nem420\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nThe Count of Monte Cristo\nThe Hard Word\nThe Two Jakes\nBlue Streak\nHeaven\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

It just\nnever lets up, and it has Stallone at the top of his game. Its comic strip\nstuff, and is much less credible than First Blood. I don't care about that\nthough, you want a serious film then watch The Deer Hunter or Platoon, but\nif you want to see a superbly made action film watch this. After the events\nof First Blood, John Rambo is in prison but gets released to be sent back to\nVietnam to take pictures of a pow camp to get proof that there is still\nAmerican pow's there. But he is double-crossed by his superiors when he\ntries to take some pow's out with him, he wasn't meant to do that, he was\nordered to only take photos, so he's left behind to be captured , imprisoned\nand tortured by those oh so nasty RUSSIANS! Sly really had it in for the\nreds in 1985 after this film, he sent Rocky out to Russia to beat up that\nother nasty Russian Ivan Drago! It must have been what the people wanted as\nthis and Rocky IV were two of the biggest smashes of the year. Steven\nBerkhoff plays the Russian bad guy in practically a carbon copy of his role\nin the James Bond film Octopussy, he does it well though, he was one of\nHollywoods favourite bad guys of the mid 80's, you might remember him in\nBeverly Hills Cop, which was a film initially intended for........Sylvester\nStallone! This movie has just been giving the DVD special edition treatment,\nbuy it, and get yourself one of the greatest action flms ever\nmade.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nStallone actually directed First Blood part II\nWisconsin_Film_Student\nWho would win?

It's an enjoyable movie, non-formulaic and with some good acting. I\nparticularly enjoyed Jake Lloyd's performance, which is why I looked\nforward\nto seeing him as Anakin Skywalker. Boy, all I can say is that direction\nmust\nmake a huge difference. He was much stiffer and forced in SW:TPM than in\nthis movie, in which he was natural and sweet. Worth a rental just to see\nhow talented this kid actually is.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Unhook the Stars (1996)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nHow does it end?

YesWell-acted ?Yes, 19 March 2006\nAuthor:\nglennandrews from Sweden\nAlways a pleasure to enjoy the talent of Julie Walters, here she is\nsupported by an exceptionally gifted cast. Starting and ending in the\nluxury of New York, the main story in the film takes place in the slums\nof Liverpool with any number of quite believable scenes. The supporting\ncast may be drawn with a rather thick felt pen but add enormous colour\nto the general atmosphere. This is a film which will obviously mean\nmore to, and be enjoyed more by English audiences. So much of the\ndialogue and so many remarks are probably incomprehensible to other\nnationalities and that includes Americans. This is a film to be enjoyed\nfor all its good points and not to be criticized for all its\nweaknessess. The right type of viewer will find themselves wondering if\nthey are crying from laughter or pure sentiment.

When I found\nthat copy, I had never even heard of the special before. But it caught\nmy attention because I'm a big Monty Python fan and saw John Cleese on\nthe front cover. So I looked at the back, and it looked like a comedy\npiece that I would want to see. So I rented it. When I watched it, I\nwasn't disappointed. There are some mildly lame moments, but for the\nmost part, it's very funny. How To Irritate People is a mockumentary, pretending to be an\neducational program. Narrated by John Cleese, it shows several sketches\nthat are supposed give viewers instructions on how to irritate people,\nin various situations! Of course, these things should not be tried in\nreal life, and this whole thing was only made for entertainment.This special came out the year before the legendary comedy team Monty\nPython started out with their hit TV series, Monty Python's Flying\nCircus. It features three Pythons. That of course includes John Cleese,\nand the two others are the late Graham Chapman, along with Michael\nPalin. The humour in this special is basically the same style of humour\nthat Monty Python was always known for, so if you don't like that, then\nthere's obviously no point in watching this. I probably didn't have to\ntell you that. But if you're a Monty Python fan, just like me, then I\nwould say that How To Irritate People is worth watching. It may not\nquite match Monty Python's best work, but it comes close enough.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for How to Irritate People (1968) (TV)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nThe War Against Terror: The Musical\nWaiting for Guffman\nDouglas\nShakespeare in... and Out\nThis Is Spinal Tap\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

In addition to the inside-joke casting of Colin Firth as Mark Darcy, there are several other allusions to Jane Austen's story: Mark disparages Bridget to his mother within earshot of Bridget. In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Darcy disparages Elizabeth to his friend Mr. Bingley within earshot of Elizabeth. Daniel Cleaver lies to Bridget about a dispute between him and Mark, claiming Mark stole his fianc\u00e9e; in fact, it was the other way around. In Pride and Prejudice, it's a dispute between Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy, and Wickham lies about who's at fault. The Darcy in both stories fails to disabuse the heroine's misinformed notion until it's almost too late. Bridget works at Pemberley Press; Mr. Darcy lives at Pemberley estate. Crispin Bonham-Carter was in both productions (his scenes were cut out of Bridget Jones's Diary, although he can still be seen in the job-quitting scene and can also be seen at the Kafka book launch where Bridget asks Salman Rushdie where the toilets are - he is seen as the man on the left in the conversation.).\nmore\nGoofs:\nContinuity: When we first see Bridget writing in her diary, listing the type of person she's not going to get involved with (with narration), she is writing on the left-hand page. In the next shot, she is at the bottom of the right-hand page.\nmore\nQuotes:\nBridget:\nThe only thing worse than smug married couple; lots of smug married couples.\nmore\nMovie Connections:\nSpoofed in \"Torchwood: Greeks Bearing Gifts (#1.7)\" (2006)\nmore\nSoundtrack:\nME AND MRS JONES\nmore\nThis FAQ is empty.

It sure seemed familiar and lo and behold then I read\nabout the Pride and Prejudice connection and then it all made complete\nsense.This is such a charming, lovely homage to Pride and Prejudice. The\nthree lead characters are just perfect. It is funny, sweet at times,\nsad at others, and just wonderfully sexy and v. romantic (especially\nthe last 1/4th of it).Renee is so extraordinary as Bridget Jones, who would have ever thought\nshe could play so believable a modern Brit woman so well. Her accent\nseems flawless to me. Hugh Grant is hilarious and a charming Lothario\nthroughout. But Colin Firth is who really sold me on this film. His\nability to play a guy that you start out not liking but drooling over\nby the end of the movie is sublime.I am a big fan of the less is more style of acting that Mr. Firth puts\nforth in this film...much of his performance is in his eyes and his\nfacial expressions. While Daniel (Mr. Grant's character) chatters on\nand on and tries to charm with his wit and words, Mark Darcy (Mr.\nFirth's character) just has a strong and rather silent presence along\nwith an integrity of character that is revealed and he wins us over (as\nwell as Bridget).This movie has a lot going on outside of the wonderful romance as well.\nContemporary events, gender inequities, social differences, work place\ndecorum, fashion, self-image, sex, family, and friendship all come\nunder the scrutiny of Bridget Jones and her diary.This is a very good adaptation of a beloved novel. The tone, scene\nselection, dialogue and characters capture the essence of what fans of\nthe book love about it. I cannot imagine it any better cast or written.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Bridget Jones's Diary (2001)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nColin Firth or Hugh Grant?\nnikki16\nDo you think single women are portrayed realistically through BJ?\nskdabrowski\nFight Scene\nkambo63\nBridget Jones was not overweight\naupied2002\nBridget's Accent\nsuedepatch\nThe final scene-- kissing\nWoHoW\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nBridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\nLove Actually\nOn Her Majesty's Secret Service\nPeyton Place\nStrange Planet\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

The\nmovie asks the eternal questions regarding the nature of being and the\ndefinitions that are agreed to and imposed by society, in all of its forms.\nEverything is described in this movie, including censorship and propaganda\nwhich are all delivered under the guise of benevolent tyranny. The fact\nthat\na good portion of events described in the movie aren't historically\naccurate, doesn't mar the precise and razor sharp script (an English\ntranslation of a German Play). It is hard to distill or summarize this\nmovie\nwith any acuity, except to say that the ideas that are described are\nexactly\nwhat is required and nothing more. I'll end with a quote from the beginning\nof the movie, \"...see Marat debating with De Sade, each one wrestling with\neach other's views. Who's the winner?

Sizemore,\nSizemore and Sizemore.Dylan McDermott is alright and all, beefcake does nothing for me. A\ndozen guys could've played this part. A half dozen would've made\nsomething of it. Sharon Stone... anyone could have played her part, and\nshe acted as if she was proving just that. She looked good doing it, no\nsurprise. A little slow moving and the plot is very predictable but a\nnice ending semi-twist.It is Tom Sizemore's performance that makes this film worth watching. I\nalways liked this guy but he does a good-to-great weirdo in this movie.7 out of 10... Too generous??

I love Winnie the Pooh and I love watching most of his films\nbut I can safely say that this one is unbearable! Rabbit hates Easter\nand becomes emotionally saddened about it for a very pointless reason -\nbecause he felt left out when everyone else was having fun! The\nnarrator is more of one of the supporting characters and just like\neveryone else, he acts like a total idiot. Also, I can't believe people\nmake far too big a deal of \"Rabbit's Rubbish Reason\" as I call it. Why\ncan't they just say \"oh, Rabbit, surely you're not getting into a state\nover just that! Snap out of it, pal!\" instead of \"oh, dear, you are\nunhappy, aren't you? We honestly didn't mean to hurt your feelings,\nRabbit. We just wanted Roo to be happy on his first Easter.\" At the end\nof the film we see Rabbit singing the insufferable song \"Cos what I\nlike most about Easter\" and then gives Roo a hug, Tigger cries\nemotionally at that touching, tearful moment that'll touch the hearts\nof all that see it - (blowing a raspberry) uh, yeah right!!! Honest to\nGOD! What's so emotionally moving about having a hug? And, also, what's\nso tear-jerking about singing that stupid song? About two years ago mum\ngot it on video from Safeway and I only saw it once. I don't know where\nit is now and quite frankly I don't care! \"Winnie the Pooh: Springtime\nwith Roo\" is a very cheap, poor film that is a real waste of time.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Winnie the Pooh: Springtime with Roo (2004) (V)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nWinnie the Pooh: A Valentine for You\nWinnie the Pooh & Christmas Too\nThe Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\nWinnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore\nBoo to You Too!

One is a\nscrewball comedy that takes up most of the first half of the movie. It\ncovers the romance between Sam, the average Joe sports columnist, and Tess,\nthe sophisticated, globe-trotting political columnist. The scenes where they\nboth try and adapt to the others life are hysterical.The second movie covers the relationship as it implausibly deepens into\nromance, leading to marriage. The clash of lifestyles and personalities\ndrives the couple further and further apart endangering the marriage.This\nmovie is not a comedy.The first half of the movie is mostly comedy, the second mostly drama.\nComedy does raise it's head throughout, and this, in my opinion saves the\nmovie from catastrophe. As it is, it's pretty good, but not a classic by any\nstretch in my opinion.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Woman of the Year (1942)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nThe Couple's Bed\ngjampol\nBest pairing of Hepburn + Tracy?\npeartree1402\nwedding ceremony\nhomestead-2\nclassical music in the background?\nmiss_penny_lane\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nHis Girl Friday\nIntolerable Cruelty\nI Love Trouble\nOne Fine Day\nMuch Ado About Nothing\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

In 1987, both of this movie's main future\npremises \u2013 that autonomous, artificially intelligent robotic \"perfect\ncompanions\" would exist as consumer products by about 2000, and that\nAmerica would suffer a partial political collapse in the same decade \u2013\nwere not particularly outlandish.While Cherry 2000 is presently achieving cult film status, it was\noriginally received as a much more conventional SF movie.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Cherry 2000 (1987)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nWho played Elaine a.k.a.

The film was very well advertised in TV but\nunfortunately it was a complete flop at the box office(Less than 50\nmillion\npesetas for more than 100 copies), but despite that and even recognizing\nthat it is a quite weak movie I prefer this to the mentioned \"Faust\". The\nplot is typical but at least it has more sense and less holes than\nFantastic\nFactory\u00b4s first movie and the acting was also a bit better, so people\ndidn\u00b4t\nlaugh at the theater(In \"Faust\" as I said they were frequently doing\nso).For\n\"Arachnid\" I think that the producers had a clearer idea of what they\nwanted\nto do, a typical B movie similar to those B fantastic movies that Filmax\nhas\nbeen distributing in video during all its existence something like\n\"Spiders\"\nor \"Crocodile\" with sometimes bad special effects and where the job by\nSholder is far from being so inspired as in \"Hidden\" or \"A nightmare on\nElm\nStreet 2\" but nevertheless the film has some good points and Sholder gets\none memorable scene about the killing of a guy by a group of mutant ticks\nwhich is the best of the movie and which is, no doubt, the best goric\nscene\nthat I have seen lately.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Arachnid (2001)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nJust saw on Sci-Fi, and the end...?\nops_kt\nWhat in the world?\nlumpywumpkins\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nCannibal Holocaust\nAnacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid\nKing Kong\nKing Kong\nThe Mysterious Pilot\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Where films like Full Meal Jacket and Jarhead present the\nbehavioural disintegration of their subjects, this film offers a more\nsubconscious vision of where the personality goes when fragmented by\nthe rigours of a depersonalising military command. This is not a film\nfor viewers after a coherent narrative or a dialogue-driven journey,\nbut for those brave enough to surrender their militant devotion to\nnarrative film boundaries and spoon-fed cinematic experiences there is\nplenty here to explore. If films such as Father and Son excited your\nurge to introspection, this film will be a worthwhile venture. If a\nslowly evolving, visually commanding exploration of the male psyche and\nbody in the Russian military and the relationship between men in such\ncircumstances isn't where you are at I would settle for something less\nchallenging.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Sto dney do prikaza (1990)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nS.E.R. - Svoboda eto rai\nProspero's Books\nTomato Kecchappu K\u00f4tei\nHong ying tao\nBeau travail\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Steve Burrows is more committed to the art of\nfunny than anyone I've ever met. His timing is impeccable, his\nperformance is charming, his writing is off-beat, and he's not a\npretty boy (at all). I've had the pleasure of working with Steve\nrecently, and this movie is one of the reasons why I even wanted\nto. See it as soon as it's released (last Iheard was later this\nyear).Whoever gave this film a BAD review has no sense of humor. You\ncan't deny funny when it's there. And funny is all over this flick.Okay, nuff said. See the film. Even if it's just because Steve's a nice\nguy.

Add the first question.\n(Comment on this title)\n1 out of 1 people found the following comment useful:-\nLets get physical, 12 November 2005\nAuthor:\nChip_douglas from Rijswijk (ZH), The Netherlands\nChris Kattan might well be the greatest physical comedian they ever had\non Saturday Night Live. Only Jim Carrey's work on \"In Living Color\"\nsurpasses him. Like Carrey, Kattan is the kind of comedian that you\neither love or hate. Or you might love him at first but eventually\nhe'll get on your nerves. Kattan also has this gay stigma hanging over\nhis head, hindering a successful movie career like Carrey and\nGroundlings pal Will Ferrell. At least for now. This compilation opens\nwith the first appearance of the Roxbury Guys, when Will and Chris were\njust trying out the idea and had not even found Haddaway's 'What is\nLove' to head-bop to. This made me expect some more Roxbury dancing\nlater on in the show, but no such luck.His many recurring characters appear one by one, including one of the\nmost elaborate Mango skits they ever did (Mango vs. J-lo), Suel\nForrester in court, the Zimmermans at Halloween (Chris and Cheri Oteri\nare a great match) and that other pair of dancing brothers, the\nDeMarco's, auditioning for Bon Jovi. For some reason Jovi seems to drag\nout the ending long past the stage of being funny. When it comes to his\nmost energetic and far out character of all, I would not have picked\nthe Mr. Peepers skit with Kevin Spacey as the best one. The ones with\nThe Rock and Tom Hanks were much funnier. Besides, I think they edited\nit somewhat. My absolute favourite in this collection has to be the\n'How do you say? Ah Yes! Show' with Antonio Banderas and Jennifer Love\nHewitt.During a montage of celebrity impressions it becomes clear Kattan is\nnot the best mimic on the show, but his take on Pacino is absolutely\nhilarious. The White trash couple is pretty disgusting, especially when\nAmy Poehlerwants to suck his toe-thumb (don't ask). As usual Fred\nArmisen steals the show in the Buddy Mills sketch, and when they get to\nGoth Talk, it's the one where his character Azrael Abbys is pretending\nto be dead. Well I guess he was always more of a sidekick in that one\nanyway. There are three clips from Weekend update, one with Norm and\ntwo with Jimmy and Tina. Kattan's first appearance as Gollum is\nactually taken from the Superbowl Half-time show. It ends with the\nSiamese twins skit with Jennifer Garner that has Chris playing a\nnormal, boring straight guy. I guess they had to reinforce that image\none last time. Either that or it was an excuse to have more Jimmy\nFallon in there. They should have put in another round of Roxbury if\nyou ask me.9 out of 10\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Saturday Night Live: The Best of Chris Kattan (2003) (TV)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nA Bug's Life\nMeet the Parents\nKeeping the Faith\nThe Opposite of Sex\nThe Big Kahuna\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Fassbinder sets the story of\nGenet against a theatrical environment, which almost has similar looks as\n'West Side Story' (The fighting-routines were inspired by the choreography\nof Jerome Robbins). This nostalgic background puts the poetical lyrics\nmore\ninto place, as we see the story of a young sailorboy develop and\nself-destruct. 'Querelle' the sailor is played by Brad Davis and his\nperformance is equally as good as in 'Midnight express'. And yes, it is\nhim\nwho's being penetrated on a table by barowner 'NoNo'.If you've seen this movie go and see these as well:My own Private Idaho\nMaurice\nPixote\nMidnight express\nBeefcake\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Querelle (1982)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nsoundtrack?\npenjo-1\nBlew my MIND\ncynema\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nA Streetcar Named Desire\nOrdinary People\nThe Mambo Kings\nLady Chatterley's Lover\nThe Deep End\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

The stars power in this movie\nis great, we have Carina Lau has Selina the lead actress who is a\npsychoanalyst, who hang out with her friends (Athena Chu has a erotic\nstory for woman, Yoyo Mung has a multi-restaurant owner who like the\ndanger side, and Pinky Cheung whose dad is a triad boss goes retirement\nand know how to fight). The story begin when Selina ex came to her and\nask her to take care of her wild daughter (Cecilia Cheung in another\nbizarre look) and tried to cure her wild behaviour. Well the rest of\nthe storyline consist of the 4 woman and there relationship with the\nguys, we have Tony Leung Ka Fai going after Carina Lau, Athena Chu\ngoing after Edisen Chen, Picky Cheung going after Andy Hui, and Lu Yi\ngoing after Yoyo Mung. The movie was mildly entertaining and the stars in this movie were fun\nto watch, but the flow and situation of the story do get tiring. Andy\nHui look hot with his bodyguard suit and his non facial expression.\nSome of the stuff in this movie is just a recycle from other movies\n(Analysis This for one), which make the movie rather less enjoyable.\nThe narrative talk from Carina was excitement giving us enough\ninformation on her friends and fine performance from everyone except\nEdisen Chen (I don't hate this fellow Canadian). This movie lack new\nidea, and the comedy is not that funny, I can't really compare to the\nHBO series because I never watched it.If you are fans of any of these stars I recommend watching this because\nthe movie wasn't boring at all. Don't expect the movie to be some\nclever script or anything special.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Sing gam diy shut (2004)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nChing mai daai wa wong\nJing gu jyun ga\nYu long gong wu\nCheng chong chui lui chai\nSing si lip yan\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Before long, a\nlittle last-minute holiday shopping for each father turns into a race\nagainst time, and each other, to get his respective hands on the\nholiday-season's \"hottest\" toy. The late Phil Hartman also co-stars as\nthe ultimate sleaze-ball neighbor.

Teruo Ishii's direction is a\nlittle flat and uneven and it's quite obvious his passion is female\nflesh, not kinetic action or creating a glorious action/erotic hybrid.\nNorifumi Suzuki, the director of \"Sex and Fury\", is a more original,\nenergetic director and brought great artistry and aesthetic brilliance\nto his work. Ishii's accomplishment is a diverting time filler with too\nmany characters, some intrigue, and mountains of softcore canoodling.\nThe opening fight scene revisits the stylistics of the original film,\nbut quickly dispenses with that style and involves itself in\nunnecessarily complex plotting. The finale is reasonably bloody, but it\nnever reaches the towering heights of its predecessor because Ishii\ndirects it like he's bored.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Yasagure anego den: s\u00f4katsu rinchi (1973)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nKuraingu fur\u00eeman\nFury\u00f4 anego den: Inoshika Och\u00f4\nCrying Freeman 2: F\u00fbsei kakurei\nSilver - shirubaa\nKoroshiya 1\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

I bought Sleepover\nNightmare because it was filmed at my favorite performer's house. But\nit's an okay movie. I'm glad most of the gore was implied rather than\nexplicitly shown! Same for the sex scenes. And the characters at least\nshowed some sense by sticking together once they realized what was\nhappening.It did seem odd that the party ended so early and most of the kids left\nso soon, but I suppose that was necessary so more attention could be\nfocused on the main characters.A question though - don't Canadian cars have airbags, especially the\npolice cars? All those car crashes and not one airbag deployed? Give me\na break! Still, I think this is a movie that people who like this genre\nwould enjoy.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Sleepover Nightmare (2005) (V)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nboon collins films\nredneckdan76\nwhat the hell was this?\nwarr10r\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nSlaughter High\nFreddy vs. Jason\nThe Fear: Resurrection\nA Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge\nHide and Go Shriek\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Add the first question.\n(Comment on this title)\n12 out of 16 people found the following comment useful:-\nInteresting and deep, but not as deep as it tries to be, 23 June 2004\nAuthor:\nGrann-Bach (Grann-Bach@jubii.dk) from Denmark\nThis is a great film; it has pretty much everything a great film needs: a\ngreat score, great actors, great performances, etc. The film revolves around\nGhost Dog, perfectly portrayed by Forest Whitaker. He is a assassin who\nlives by the code of the Samurai. Apart from him, we also follow the fate of\nseveral mafia men(though nowhere near as intimately as we follow Ghost Dog).\nThese two very different groups, Samurai and mafia, are both depicted\nreasonably well, giving us insight to how the groups work, and, more\nimportantly, their code. Both groups live and die by the code, and this is\nprobably the most important thing in the movie, and it's shown with respect\nwith both Samurai and mafia; I'm not entirely sure that it's correct all the\nway through, but that's not what's most important, anyway. The film has\nreasonably little action, but it's not supposed to be an action film, by any\nmeans. It's fairly slow throughout the film, but it never really bores you\nto the point of not watching any more; I've seen the film at least five\ntimes now, so believe me, I know. The film is very stylized and cool\nthroughout, which definitely has some part in keeping you interested, but\nthe theme and story/plot plays a bigger part, I think. The plot is pretty\ngood, and though it keeps a fairly slow pace throughout the film, it also\nkeeps your interest for the entire duration of the film. The acting is all\ngood, though not everyone pulls off as excellent a performance as Whitaker.\nIsaach De Bankol\u00e9 portrays Ghost Dog's best friend, and he does gives a\ngreat performance. So does Camille Winbush, who portrays a girl who Ghost\nDog befriends and discusses books with. The characters are well-written\nand(mostly) credible. I'm not entirely sure that the film does provide a\ntotally correct version of the Code of the Samurai. The soundtrack is great;\nit's made by the hip-hop artist RZA, but most of it will be enjoyable to\npeople who aren't into hip-hop. Also, I guess it's more of a score than a\nsoundtrack; there isn't any time where the music feels out of place in a\nscene. All in all, a great film, but not for all tastes. Don't go in\nexpecting an action film; don't go in expecting a very deep an entirely\nintellectual film; don't go in expecting a regular movie; go in expecting to\nsee a decent(if not good) representation of both the mafia code and the\nSamurai code. I've heard some people describe the ending as an anti-climax;\nI don't know what they were expecting... I won't say that I saw it coming,\nbut I wasn't disappointed when it happened. It had to end it, and I think\nthe director, Jim Jarmusch made a good decision on that. I recommend this\nfilm to people with an interest in Samurai, fans of Jarmusch and people\nlooking for a reasonably deep film. I don't recommend this to fans of action\nmovies, as there's fairly little action in the film. No matter who you are,\nif you're going to see this film, make sure you have the patience for it;\nit's worth sitting through the two reasonably slow hours for.\n8/10\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nOutstanding\nNick_Hanson\nshould a great man lay down his life in the service of a lesser man?\njarmyta\nThe Blackequivalent to 'Grand Theft Auto' fantasies?\nNeroKalem\n*beep*\ncorybracken\nare you serious??\nnvp12345\nStyle over substance?

Hershey is a batty broad who\nAndrews, a taxi driver, picks up in Manhattan one night. She wants to hire\nhim to take her to the desert. Thus begins one of the worst road movies I've\nseen in years. Why these two people would even talk after spending 48 hours\ntogether, let alone become romantically involved is beyond me. Their first\nlovemaking is one of the most ridiculous scenes of it's type. The film's\nonly redeeming value comes from the performance of John Doe, as a friendly,\nhelpful local in the town where the two leads ultimately wind up.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Drowning on Dry Land (1999)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nAnimals and the Tollkeeper\nMidnight Run\nThelma & Louise\nRat Race\nSherryBaby\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

I was actually surprised by how\ngood DMX could pull off his role as the King. This movie really shows\nthe gritty, nasty truth of drug induced violence. There are no good\npeople in this film, and there are no heroes to speak of. There are\njust ugly, evil, menacing things and people sewn completely through any\nattempt at good morals. This movie definitely hold no bars on how far\nit goes. It shows practically rape, murders of innocents, hard drugs,\nand intentionally making someone you love addicted to heroin. DMX truly\nshows the King as an evil and god-awful person and by the end of the\nmovie, it is quite satisfying to connect it to the beginning. I can't\nsay this is a great movie because there aren't any redeeming values to\nit, and there is really no point in it. It does however chill your\nbones in it truthfulness, and sparks an issue that can be debated after\nthe movie is complete. Decent job guys, but give us a point and a good\nguy in there! 6/10\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Never Die Alone (2004)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nAm I the only sane one???\nsupercash79\nWas David doing Juanita in the butt?\nDAlst8\nIs it Just me?\nMs_Liu_is_Hot\nmusic in trailer\nJeepCherokee1\n??? about king david's return (spoiler)\nCory-7\nBlue\nwhoTheFuqRyou\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nCidade de Deus\nRunning Scared\nFour Brothers\nThe Punisher\nCarlito's Way\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Episodes 1-8 start after the 8th episode of the OAV series. They are based on the original Record of Lodoss War novels #3-4 by Ryo Mizuno entitled \"The Dragon of Fire Dragon Mountain I & II\". Episodes 9-27 follow the stories of the original novels #6-7 entitled \"The Holy Knight of Lodoss I & II\". Which in turn spawned the manga (18 issues) & graphic novels (6 books) available in English from CPM Manga entitled \"Record of Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight\". It is that manga series that the name of this anime series comes. Some people believe that the writers and directors \"rewrote\" the story found in episodes 9-13 in the OAV series, where in reality the intent was to convey the story as it was originally written by Mr. Mizuno the Lodoss series author and creator.\nmore\nQuotes:\nNarrator:\nThere once was a boy, who dreamt of living in a world of light. But light and shadow are the same and where once exists, so too must the other.

(relates to dubbed version), 25 February 2001\nAuthor:\npixie468 from Southern Florida\n\"Record of the Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight\" is an awesome 27\nepisode anime series. The first eight (or so) episodes are about the free\nknight Parn, his elven companion Deedlit, and many others who make a\nwonderful mercenary group. They cast spells, fight evil beings, and prevent\na black knight from taking control of Lodoss, the Accursed Island.The following 19 episodes are my favorite though. It's nine years later, and\nthe knight-in-training Spark and his recruited soldiers must save the world\nfrom a dark sorcerer and cunning goddess. The animation is very colorful and\nclean. The dialogue could use some help,\nbut the voices that speak it are very intelligible and appropriate. I loved\nthe action, and I couldn't help myself from rooting for the the \"bad guys\"\nin some cases. This television series is a great find for anime fans and\nfantasy/adventure lovers. I cheered, laughed, cried, and even dreamed about\nthis series.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for \"Lodoss to Senki: Eiyuu kishi den\" (1998)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nLodoss to senki\n\"Slayers\"\n\"Bakuretsu hunters\"\nBanpaia hant\u00e2 D\nGanso bakuretsu hunter\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

The great soundtrack's now been out on CD for a few years; the theme was\nproduced by the Pet Shop Boys and sung by authentic 60's icon Dusty\nSpringfield.All other songs chosen charted during the early 60's, giving\nthe film the ring of authenticity.And due possibly to legal problems, the\noriginal performance of Chubby Checker's THE TWIST couldn't be used, so\nChecker re-recorded it for this film.This newer, punchy 1989 version is\nthe one used today behind Pantene shampoo commercials.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Scandal (1989)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nBridget Fonda with a British accent\nXenaUK\nOne of the best films ever and a missing scene\ndani_mckinley\nAvailable on DVD?\ndebyhelen\nShe wears a red ribbon and a huli huli skirt...\ndevilsmercy03\nU.K Dvd???\npowderblue\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nThe Draughtsman's Contract\nLady Caroline Lamb\nLet Him Have It\nNineteen Eighty-Four\nThe Last September\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Worse, the special effects are shoddy, the production\nvalues cheap, and the slapstick laughs overdrawn by a director who\npractically prods you in the ribs. The Disney Company really lost more\nthan their boss when Walt died; they lost their direction, most\nespecially in their live-action entertainment, relying on sequels and\n(even today) pointless remakes that show a complete misunderstanding of\nwhat their founder was trying to do. \"Herbie\" is surely at that\nbarrel's bottom.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Herbie Rides Again (1974)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nHerbie Goes to Monte Carlo\nHerbie Fully Loaded\nThe Love Bug\nHerbie Goes Bananas\nToy Story 2\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Kilmer is very good in here, one of his\nbest performances ever and the film is nicely photographed. The only\nwarning I would give viewers is the language, which contains about 25\nf-words.The best plug I can give this film is that it was very entertaining,\nstart to finish, and that's what most of us are looking for -\nentertainment. It keeps your attention the full 100-plus minutes, so\nwhat's not to like? As mentioned, Kilmer is very, very good in here\nand, make no mistake: he's the show. Everything in the story really\nrevolves around him.There was anything that struck a sour note with me, it would be the\nstory with the kidnapped girl's father. I don't think he was realistic,\nbut I won't say more in fear of spoiling anything for those who haven't\nseen this.Nonetheless, an under-publicized excellent film of 2004.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Spartan (2004)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nBlanks?\nsuperrjon\nProblems with this film - and there are many (spoilers)\nbobbykivistik\nSoundtrack\nneoengel127\nWhooaaaaa - Pleasantly Suprised\ncoffeefilter\nSalton Sea reference?\nNick_Dets\n6.8???\nroca_sta69\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nRoad House\nAlong Came a Spider\nBasic\nThe Da Vinci Code\nThe Sum of All Fears\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Add the first question.\n(Comment on this title)\n1 out of 2 people found the following comment useful:-\nWinnie in the Doldrums, 11 May 2005\nAuthor:\ntheowinthrop from United States\nThis series was a wonderful and unexpected one a quarter century ago.\nBased on a book of the same name, it traced the missing period of\nWinston Churchill's career. Having been a leading figure in political\nlife from 1903 to 1929, and risen to such posts as Home Secretary,\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty, and Chancellor of the Exchequer, Churchill\nwas cast adrift when the Tories under Stanley Baldwin lost office to\nthe Labor Party of Ramsay MacDonald in a general election. For awhile\nBaldwin and Churchill were sitting next to each other on the front\nopposition bench in the House of Commons, but Baldwin was not that\nhappy about this. He knew that Churchill was a potential Tory rival for\nleadership, and Baldwin wanted to control those who would succeed him\nwhile he held power.The series did not quite explain Churchill's weakness here - in 1903,\nwhen he first made his name in politics, Churchill was a Tory M.P. This\nwas traditional, because his father, Lord Randolph Churchill, had also\nbeen a Tory M.P. But Lord Randolph had been a maverick, who built up a\nblock of Tories (one was future Prime Minister Arthur Balfour) called\nthe Fourth Party, and had done considerable damage to Lord Salisbury's\nparty in the 1880s. Lord Randolph did end up as Chancellor of Exchequer\nin 1887, but a political showdown miscalculation with Salisbury\nfinished his career (a case of syphilis also ruined it). Winston took\nhis father's independence to heart. He announced his rejection of the\nTory policies of his day, and \"crossed the aisle\" to sit with the\nLiberal Party. Denounced for his treason to his father's party, Winston\nactually rose to power from 1903 to 1923 as a Liberal Party leader. But\nin 1916 there was a power struggle between the Liberal Prime Minister\n(Asquith) and his successor (Lloyd George). Winston sided with Lloyd\nGeorge, and this was fine while a complicated half-Liberal/half-Tory\ncoalition existed. But it collapsed in 1922. The following year Winston\nannounced his disillusion with Liberal Party politics and crossed back\nto the Tories. Baldwin accepted it, as Churchill was experienced and\nsmart. He made him Chancellor of Exchequer in his 1924-1929\nadministration. But Baldwin (as I said) did not trust Churchill.The series never makes this clear, although Baldwin is shown to be a\nsmart politician (Winston later acknowledged that Stanley was the most\nformidable politician he ever met). It follows how Baldwin managed for\nmost of the 1930s to manipulate the weakling MacDonald (who split his\nparty on a coalition government in 1931) to keep Churchill out of the\ngovernment, and then to keep him out of the Tory government of 1935-37.\nSome of this was due to Churchill's own blundering - he opposed\nBaldwin's willingness to work with Gandhi on eventual Indian\nindependence, and he supported the pro-Nazi Edward VIII in the\nabdication crisis. Baldwin left office in 1937, having chosen Nevil\nChamberlain his successor. In retrospect Baldwin was one of Britain's\nmost successful Prime Ministers, except he could not move as fast as he\nwanted in rearming in the face of Nazi aggression (he did do what he\ncould, but the Labour Party and the Tories were not as willing to rearm\nas he was).Chamberlain would also keep Churchill at bay, but he came acropper due\nto Hitler's aggressions and Munich. But Churchill would not be called\nback until Britain would return to war in 1939, and would not become\nPrime Minister until 1940.The series was fair in showing that Baldwin was a clever political\nmanipulator. And Eric Porter did a marvelous job as Baldwin's right\nhand man (and successor) Chamberlain, reminding the audience that had\nit been a peaceful period Chamberlain would have reformed the British\neducation system and the tax system. He just was tragically unprepared\nto handle Hitler (who indeed was?). Best was Robert Hardy, whose\nChurchill was the best ever done dramatically on television. Not only\nhis political miscalculations were shown, but his financial problems,\nhis growing literary work (remember, he won the Nobel Prize for\nLiterature as a historian), and his family problems with wife\nClementine (Sian Philips), who had an affair, and his son Randolph, who\nwas too undisciplined to have a political career. One hopes the series\nwill be shown again someday.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for \"Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years\" (1981) (mini)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nGandhi\nThe Gathering Storm\nThe Last Emperor\nDisraeli\nThe Final Cut\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

At first sight, this movie does not look very differently from the\nother action or horror flicks I saw recently. However, it has a quality and\ncoherence that is not usual for movies in its class. Without any known name\nin the cast, with a low budget and according to some of the critics in only\n19 days, director Richard Gale succeeded to make a very decent movie. His\nhand is sure, his cut is professional, and the movie might have been\nlow-cost for the producers, but never looks cheap. I also think that\nsomething deeper about the American gun culture is trespassing the screen. I\nexpect nice surprises from this director in the future. 7/10 on my personal\nscale.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Pressure (2002)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nBlack Point\nExtreme Prejudice\nMarshal Law\nKnockaround Guys\nDesert Saints\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

It deals\nwith some highly unusual people living in some highly unusual houses.\nAfter a quick round-robin visit to each house and occupants, that lasts\nabout ten minutes, we know about as much about these people and their\nhouses as we find out in the next hour. We are left with wanting to\nknow more about how these people came to be in their current situations\nand about the history of their houses. For example, the alligator man\nsays that everything in his house has a sentimental value - then show\nus some of those things and explain to us what they mean to him.I wanted to see more about the houses themselves - how they are laid\nout and how the people live in them. The people who live in the old\nmissile silo give us a ten second tour of where the rooms are in their\nhouse *from above ground,* and that is it for the overview.These people are satisfying some deep emotions through their living\nenvironments and I wanted to know more. Think what Errol Morris would\nhave done with this material.The film indeed has the look of a home movie, so the title is a clever\npun.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Home Movie (2001)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nthe mannequin guy\nlunabean1978\nThis was not originally a movie...\nfelixblackcat\nwas this shown anywhere\nmajaco\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nLive and Let Die\nThe Aviator\nJoe Dirt\nThe Lake House\nStrange Planet\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

The quality is leaps and bounds over the series, and\nthe movie is made to be a fan's dream. The entire movie start to finish\nseems made with the fan in mind. The animation quality is top notch. From\nthe little things like eye movement to the big things like debris and\ndestruction of a city. It's all done superbly well and it all looks\nabsolutely wonderful.The story is quite nice as well, though nothing too extreme. They managed to\nsqueeze in the origins of just about anything and everything. Yet, it never\nseems forced... there's never a scene that was obviously put in just to\nexplain something.The sound and music is perfect with the movie. The music fits it very well\nand the subtle cues really draw the fans in. The VA's do a wonderful job as\nwell, there's really nothing to dislike.It's far from a deep movie, and it's certainly no epic animation. But for\nfans of the show it's PPG perfection. For folks yet to see the show, it's a\nvery entertaining flick well worth your time. The full length commentary on\nthe dvd by the director and art director is well worth watching by itself.\nNot only is it great to hear a behind the scenes look, there's many great\ntips for artists spread around on how they made certain effects and made\nsome effects easier. The commentary is worth the rental\nalone.- Rirath_com\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for The Powerpuff Girls (2002)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nMovie was announced in year 2000\nBeletje\nAbout Mojo JoJo's plan......\nangussu\nWhere's the Extra Guy????\nyomi_15\nWhy did I even watch it?\nDavid_Howard\nVERY DISSAPOINTING\npinknavelring\nFavorite Powerpuff\npowerpuffkn-1\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nThe Incredibles\nThe Flintstones\nSpy Kids 2: Island of Lost Dreams\nSpy Kids 3-D: Game Over\nThe Transformers: The Movie\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

I was wrong. A good cast (Roy Scheider as the president) didn't help it any. The\nstory had every conceivable possible worst-case scenario that could\ntake place in a terrorist nuclear disaster. And none of it could\nPOSSIBLY happen! True -- the kidnapping of the President could only be accomplished with\nthe inside help of a traitor in the Secret Service (ala Air Force One),\nbut everything they depicted regarding the FOOTBALL and the\nhelplessness of our country if were to fall into enemy hands is\nludicrous to the Nth degree. Seriously, not even the President can\nfully over-ride our missile control. The case is only used to relay\norders. In this situation, our system would have completely deleted the\ncodes and the whole thing would go nowhere. The destruction of Beijing\ncouldn't happen -- there would not have been a missile launch because\nthe silo-crews would have been instructed not to (communications\ninclude a hardwired system). There are just too many safe-guards to\nprevent such a thing from happening. True, film's like FAIL-SAFE and STRANGELOVE gave some credibility to\nthe concept of us losing control of THE SYSTEM. But this film goes too\nfar and fails to suspend my concept of the unbelievable. And that makes\nthe experience a waste of the viewer's time.

Add the first question.\n(Comment on this title)\n6 out of 6 people found the following comment useful:-\nWelcome back after 27 years!, 4 August 2000\nAuthor:\nfrank behrens (behrens@top.monad.net) from Keene, NH\nIt took only a quarter century to catch up with Lord Peter Wimsey:\nMurder Must Advertise and I am eternally grateful to Acorn Media for\nmaking it available, along with \"Clouds of Witness\" and \"The\nUnpleasantness\nat the Bellona Club.\" Yes, \"Five Red Herrings\" and \"The Nine Tailors\" are\ndue soon.Having read the book several times, I can say that the dramatization is\nnot only faithful to the plot but also to the comic tone of the original.\nSayers herself did work in an advertising agency and she perfectly catches\nthe chaos, the frustrations, and the high spirits that pervade such an\nestablishment.Even more on video than in the novel is each character fully realized.\nWhen Wimsey (working under an alias) first enters the secretaries' room,\nthe\nmore flamboyant of the women (played by Fiona Walker) is found coffee cup\nhigh in the air and sheet of advertising copy low in hand, thereby\nestablishing her character perfectly. She can also quote Latin tags and\nShakespeare with colloquial ease.The stuffy head of the firm, Mr. Pym,\nis\nplayed by Peter Pratt, well known to Gilbert & Sullivan buffs as the comic\nlead at the D'Oyly Carte several generations ago.The ubiquitous Peter Bowles plays the villainous Major Milligan as a\ndope\ndealer to the \"bright young things\" who still knows when to apologize for\nrudeness. Mark Eden continues his role as Chief Inspector Parker, now\nWimsey's brother-in-law since marrying into the family after the \"Clouds\nof\nWitness\" case. If I cannot warm up to Lady Mary (Rachel Herbert), it is\nperhaps because of her smugness that tries to be charming but (for me)\njust\nmisses.Possibly the best realized character is Bridget Armstrong's Dian de\nMomerie, the fading sexpot who knows she is doomed by her associates, her\ndrug taking, and the ravages of time. Armstrong turns what could have been\nan utterly cliched role into a sympathetic and believable\none.And of course, Ian Carmichael is the same bubbling amateur sleuth of\nthe\nfirst two mysteries, always ready to apologize for forgetting he has\nadvantages over most of the others.The plot combines a simple whodunit with a complex howsitdun; and if\nyou\npay close attention to the most seemingly inconsequential lines in the\nfirst\nepisodes, you will appreciate all the more the solution in the last one. I\nwill reveal none of the plot here, except to say it is a lot of\nfun.The production budget is below that of the Poirot series, but the\nperiod\nfeel is just as good. By the way, when Wimsey (in disguise) is compared\nwith\nBertie Wooster, the script writer might be indulging in an inside joke:\nIan\nCarmichael did play Wooster in a series on British TV and that association\nnearly cost him getting Wimsey after he himself suggested it to the powers\nthat be!\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for \"Murder Must Advertise\" (1973) (mini)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\n\"The Nine Tailors\"\nSecret Agent\nAn Unsuitable Job for a Woman\n\"Cadfael\"\n\"Inspector Morse\"\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Part of the success of the movie lies in\nthe screen play by Ernest Lehman, one of the best writers of that era.\nAlso, the haunting music by Mr. Hitchcock's usual collaborator, Bernard\nHermann, adds texture to what we are seeing. Together with all the\nabove mentioned qualities, \"North by Northwest\" was photographed by\nRobert Burks and was edited by George Tomasini, both men did\noutstanding jobs to enhance a film that shows a mature and inspired\nAlfred Hitchcock.The film works because of the witty dialog Mr. Lehman wrote. This has\nto be one of the riskiest projects undertaken by Mr. Hitchcock because\nof the sexiness Eva Kendall exudes throughout the film and the repartee\nbetween her and Roger Thornhill. The film mixes adventure and romance\nthat aren't put ons, as one feels what one's watching to be really\nhappening.Much has been said in this forum as to the values of this classic, so\nwe shall only add our pleasure in seeing this masterpiece any time it\nturns on cable. In fact, the film hasn't dated, the way some others of\nthe same period have. The highlights of the film are the sequences\ninvolving the crop duster, the train ride to Chicago where Eve and\nRoger first meet, the auction, and the Mount Rushmore climax.This is one of the best contributions by Cary Grant to any of his work\nwith the director. Roger Thornhill is one of the best roles Mr. Grant\nplayed, during his long career. His chemistry with Eva Marie Saint is\nperfect. This young actress added class and elegance to the picture.\nJames Mason and Martin Landau played villains convincingly. Jesse Royce\nLandis, Leo G. Carroll, and the rest of the supporting cast is\nexcellent.\"North by Northwest\" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best crafted films\nthanks to the brilliant people that came together to work in it.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for North by Northwest (1959)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nEmil?\nka-armour\nTheatre Tickets!\nstomaino\nA Bad1959 Review of 'North by Northwest'\necarle\nVan Dam's house in Montana -- was it real?\nriegelsvillegrrrl\n'The Midpoint Movie' -- And Almost As Important As Psycho\necarle\nUK trains ad. with NbNW footage\nswanstep\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nRaiders of the Lost Ark\nDick Tracy Returns\nxXx\nMarathon Man\nLive and Let Die\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Later in the series, the second wave also leaves a rip in the\nuniverse ('Cosmic Fracture') that the cadets of Stellvia will have to\ncombat along with some UFOs.The main character, Shima, is a programming genius (and complete\nklutz). She along with Arisa and her other friends, tough their way\nthrough the academy and life as they prepare for the missions.This series has a marvelous intro and closing song plus a nice mix of\nanimation with CGI that doesn't let the CGI make the series too glossy\n(like is problematic with series such as IGPX).

Everyone should know that,\nspecially while watching Airplane 2. In my opinion, Airplane 2 still has the\nsame quality of humor as Airplane does and it only repeats a few jokes. It\nnever seemed repetitive for me, but maybe for most people it can get old to\nsee two movies with the exact same type of humor and the same type of\nuniverse and imagery. I thought it was really funny that they went into\nspace this time, and they could have done a lot more science fiction movie\nrelated jokes, but they didn't, and I suppose that's okay. I didn't expect\nit to be as good as the first one, really. Of course the first one was\nbetter, but I wouldn't say it was much better. I've seen much worse sequels\nfor comedy movies.\nI personally thought it did fine as a sequel and I'd recommend it to anyone\nwho liked the first one.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Airplane II: The Sequel (1982)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nTrivia wrong\nWing_nut\nWhich Airplane! movie is this line from?\nfirestongue\nCould this movie have been rated PG-13......wasn't it originally R?\nmwplefty\nI don't mean to sound forward woman\ncamerabugs\nJive Talking\nkcuber\nSo much better than -insert genre- Movie\nrwood-10\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nAirplane!\nThumb Wars: The Phantom Cuticle\nSpaceballs\nThe Ambushers\nRobinson Crusoe of Clipper Island\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

One thing I really enjoy in movies from that neck of\nthe world is the fact that we're not dealing with professional actors\nhere. Most of the characters are played by regular Joes and it adds on\nto the experience. \"Marooned in Iraq\" also shows the daily life of the\nKurds, being bombarded by Saddam's planes. Interesting look at the\nculture, at the way of making a living, like at the brick work. As in\n\"A Time for Drunken Horses\", I was also very moved by the look in the\nchildren's eyes. The cinematography is also beautiful. And I enjoyed\nthe traditional music. Rent this one (or get it at your local library\nlike I did) and see for yourself Mirza's odyssey. It plays almost like\na treasure hunt. One negative note though: I saw the film on DVD and I\nsuspect that the subtitles didn't really captured what the characters\nwere saying. Unless Kurds are using 10 words for 1 English or French\none, I got robbed of a lot of the dialog. Too bad.Seen at home, in Toronto, on September 16th, 2005.80/100 (***)\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Gomgashtei dar Aragh (2002)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nZamani baray\u00e9 masti asbha\nNiwe mung\nDavid & Layla\nKilom\u00e8tre z\u00e9ro\nTakht\u00e9 siah\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Also Erin Chandler (Miss Make Do) is impressive...she is\nexcellent as Leslie's muse! Michelle Phillips is wonderful and there\nare several other surprise cameos such as John Ritter as the\nimpassioned preacher! It captures the dilemma of being gay not only in\nthe world but in the very judgmental south! Mark Pellegrino plays a\ngorgeous Tripper! Some feel the piece is dark but it is a very\nrealistic look at homosexuality in the 70's! No wonder this film won\nseveral independent film festivals!\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Lost in the Pershing Point Hotel (2000)\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nTorch Song Trilogy\nRent\nMidnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\nShortbus\nStar Maps\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

Yes, my parents were asleep and we\nwe're the first kids on my block to get cable. So yes, I tip toed downstairs\nin the middle of the night to watch this movie. I don't know what the adults\nthough of this film, but all I knew, was this woman got naked in front of a\nchild. Not only that, but sex followed! For being the only eight year-old in\nthe room, I wasn't about to change the channel to watch cartoons. I guess\nyou can say this was a coming of age drama if not a sad black comedy about\nsex, relationship, and finding sex and a relationship in the most unlikely\nplaces. All in all, I remember the movie (at such a young age) because of\nthe subject matter. The overall story of the movie? Couldn't tell you. I\nwasn't listening to anything the actors were saying.

I am not a\nShakespeare expert,but I love history and the 1930s and 1940s are my\nfavourite period,so I love the way the our odd Royal Family is shown in\nthis film,we know that members of the royal family were pro fascist in\nthe 1930s so why not update the original story. The locations and the\nproduction design are great and the acting is impressive throughout. As\nfor the comment about the murder in bed,it seems like a good plan to\nme,if you were busy with a flight attendant you are not going to notice\nan assassin under the bed. If you have not seen this I urge you to do\nso,you can watch it as a war movie or as a version of the play.\nWas the above comment useful to you?\nmore\nDiscuss this title with other users on IMDb message board for Richard III (1995)\nRecent Posts (updated daily)User\nFavorite moment?\npalehorse864\nAmazing!\nJasonMcDonald60\nMusic Score Question Spoilers\nValmont334\nLIES!!\ntinkerbell52504\nlocations\nficelle-n-co\nEnd of Film (Spoiler)\nthaLegend\nmore\nIf you enjoyed this title, our database also recommends:\nRichard III\nThe Tragedy of Macbeth\nRomeo + Juliet\nLegends of the Fall\nHamlet\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nIMDb User Rating:\nAdd a recommendation |\nShow more recommendations\nYou may report errors and omissions on this page to the IMDb database managers.

    "body": "Generation and Uses of Machine-Readable Data Bases\n\nThis chapter continues the coverage of the generation and use of\nmachine-readable data bases inaugurated in Volume 9 by Williams (178). It\nis therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is prepared\nin general accordance with Williams's initial compilation.\nThe same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applications\nused in Volume 9 are continued this year. A data base is considered\nto be an organized collection of machine-readable records containing\nbibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information).\nThe data bases that we will consider are used for information storage\nand retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval or\ndata base generation.\nThe choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas. First,\ndata bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographic\ninformation, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded.\nThus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number\nis a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such as\nthat by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39)\nare excluded. Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic material\nis included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, most\nof the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in a\nshipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of this\nchapter. Finally, though many of the data bases are used for generation\nof publications via phototypesetting, we are not considering that production\noperation.\nBack to Books",

    "body": "A Note on the Pseudo-Mathematics of Relevance\n\nRecently a number of articles, books, and reports\ndealing with information systems, i.e., document retrieval\nsystems, have advanced the doctrine that such systems\nare to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentage\nof relevancy they provide.\nAlthough there seems to be little agreement on what\nrelevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable,\nthere is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed\nand formal relationship exists between the relevance and\nthe recall performance of any system. Thus, we will find\nin the literature both a frankly subjective notion of\nrelevance as reported by individual users, and equations,\ncurves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide\nnumerical measures of the recall and relevance\ncharacteristics of information systems. This phenomenon\nof shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective\nand non-mathematical term to equations in which the\nsame term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical\ndefinition has its ancient parallel in discussions\nof probability. One cannot, of course, legislate the\nmeaning of a term. It all depends, as Alice pointed out,\non \"who is master,\" the user or the term. On the other hand,\nthe use of a single term in the same document to cover\ntwo or more distinct meanings, especially when such a\nusage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine\nby attributing to it mathematical validity which it does\nnot have, represents a more serious situation than merely\ncareless ambiguity.\nBack to Books",

    "body": "Warming 'may cause economic chaos'\nLONDON, England -- Climate change could devastate the global economy on a scale of the two world wars and the depression of the 1930s if left unchecked, a top economist has warned.\nIntroducing the report by Nicholas Stern, the British government also said Monday that former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who is now a vocal environmental advocate, is to serve as one of its advisers on the issue.\nThe report's main argument is that the benefits of coordinated action around the world to tackle global warming will greatly outweigh any financial costs.\nBut Stern, a former World Bank economist, who wrote the report commissioned by ministers, concludes that ignoring climate change could lead to huge economic upheaval.\n\"Our actions over the coming decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity, later in this century and in the next, on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century,\" he said.\nThe report said global warming could result in melting glaciers, rising sea levels, falling crop yields, drinking water shortages, higher death tolls from malnutrition and heat stress, and outbreaks of malaria and dengue fever.\nAnd richer nations must be prepared to pay more than poor ones to counter their higher emissions output, for example by green taxes or carbon trading schemes.\n\"The poor countries will be hit earliest and hardest ... It is only right that the rich countries should pay a little more,\" Stern said.\nThe report admitted its forecasts on how climate change would affect the global economy rested on sparse data about high temperatures and developing countries, and put monetary values on human health and the environment, \"which is conceptually, ethically and empirically very difficult.\"\nBut UK Prime Minister Tony Blair said if no action were taken, climate change could cost the world up to 20 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) each year.\nBlair said: \"This is the most important report on the future published by this government in its time in office.\"\nThe prospect of global warming is \"frightening,\" but the scientific case that it is taking place is now \"overwhelming,\" the PM added.\n\"This disaster is not set to happen in some science fiction future many years ahead, but in our lifetime.\n\"Unless we act now ... these consequences, disastrous as they are, will be irreversible.\"\n'Global solution'\nFinance minister Gordon Brown, who is expected to take over as prime minister next year, said harnessing markets was the best way to find new methods to cut polluting gases.\nBrown proposed an EU-wide target for emissions reductions of 30 percent by 2020 and 60 percent by 2050 and expansion of the carbon trading scheme to cover over half of emissions.\n\"Stern's report sees climate change as a global challenge that demands a global solution. The truth is we must tackle climate change internationally or we will not tackle it at all,\" Brown said.\nAlso Monday, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change said greenhouse gas emissions by industrialized countries were rising and the U.S. remained the biggest polluter.\nThe report puts the UK at odds with its main ally. U.S. President George W. Bush withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol -- which urges the 35 richest countries to cut carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels in power plants, factories and cars -- partly because he said it hit jobs.\nBut Stern said the action needed to avert the worst effects of climate change was \"manageable,\" adding: \"We can grow and be green.\"\nThe Stern review says the costs of action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the worst impacts of climate change can be limited to just 1 percent of global GDP each year.\nPeople would pay slightly more for carbon intensive goods, but the world's economies could continue to grow strongly.\nEnvironmental Economist Professor Stephen Smith, from University College London, told CNN the role of Al Gore was important to sell action on climate change to the rest of the world.\n\"The British government has recognized that it needs to do more than simply speaking to domestic audience ... it needs to build a new coalition to agree cuts in greenhouse gas emissions on the global stage, and Gore's role is clearly in that.\"\nThe report was welcomed by environmental campaigners and business leaders.\nCharlie Kronick of Greenpeace said it showed the current generation must now defeat climate change.\n\"We always knew that the scientific and moral case for action was overwhelming, but this report is the final piece in the jigsaw,\" he told the Press Association.\n\"There are no more excuses left, no more smokescreens to hide behind, now everybody has to back action to slash emissions, regardless of party or ideology.\"\nRichard Lambert, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said emissions trading between nations was required as a \"nucleus\" for action.\n\"Provided we act with sufficient speed, we will not have to make a choice between averting climate change and promoting growth and investment,\" he told PA.",

High school music teacher Janet Wolff isn't afraid to teach the accordion.\nHer teenage students don't balk at picking up the instrument or performing in an auditorium full of old-timers who take their German traditions seriously.\n\"It's just something different,\" said 17-year-old Kasandra Huber. \"I thought it would be fun. And it is fun.\"\nWishek High School has 110 students. Huber is one of seven who play the accordion, an instrument made famous by Welk, who died in 1992, and the late Myron Floren, who both entertained generations of TV viewers on \"The Lawrence Welk Show.\"\nIn Wishek, a town of about 1,100 people, the accordion players include Jason Hochhalter, 18, a muscular high school senior, and Christy Schaffer, 15, a petite, full-blooded German who has been practicing for four years.\n\"When I was younger, I thought it was something different to do,\" Schaffer said. \"My grandpa did it. And I thought it would be interesting to play something different, that no other kid was playing.\"\nWolff, who grew up in the Minneapolis area, married a German with accordions after taking the teaching job in Wishek in 1988. She thought the accordion would be perfect for performances during Sauerkraut Day, an annual sauerkraut and sausage festival held in Wishek for eight decades.\nWolff started teaching the accordion four years ago, using instruments borrowed from people in town. \"It's just another instrument to be exposed to,\" she said.\n\"I was just going to play it for a day, and then I ended up keeping it,\" said Hochhalter, who looks like he would be more at home in a weight-lifting room than a music room.\nWhen other students chimed in and good-naturedly chided him for \"stealing\" the accordion from another student, he grinned and added, \"They're just jealous.\"\n'Wunnerful, wunnerful'\nThe culture of the farming region also helps, Wolff said. Welk, the bandleader whose \"wunnerful, wunnerful\" show of the 1950s and 1960s can still be seen in public television reruns, grew up in nearby Strasburg. Many older residents converse in German, and wedding dances still feature polkas and waltzes, Wolff said.\nLisa Horner, 17, said the student accordion players are following in their grandparents' footsteps. \"It's kind of cool,\" she said.\nThe students like modern-day music but all know Lawrence Welk. \"My dad watched all the time,\" Horner said. \"He was like, 'We've got to watch Lawrence Welk.\"'\nHelmi Harrington, who runs music studios in the Minneapolis suburb of Burnsville and in Superior, Wisconsin, is the director of A World of Accordions Museum in Duluth, Minnesota. She is not surprised to hear that teenagers in North Dakota play the accordion.\n\"In the 1990s there was a trend toward nostalgia, toward finding our roots in America,\" she said. \"That always brings people back to ethnic connectors.\"\nHarrington, who has played the accordion for more than half a century, said the instrument is unique in that it creates melody, harmony and rhythm like a piano or organ, but is more portable.\n\"A single person can shine in a spotlight with marvelous notes,\" she said.\nHowever, with its keyboard, pushbuttons and bellows, \"it is a very difficult instrument to play well,\" Harrington said.\nWolff said she cannot envision teaching the accordion in a big city like Minneapolis, but has never had a student in Wishek refuse to try it.\n\"It's part of our heritage,\" Huber said.",

    "body": "Program Information\nThe Department of Computer Science at HKUST offers two degree programs for students who are interested in learning about computing and information technology:\n1. COMP: BEng in Computer Science\nThis is our general undergraduate program that provides broad education in all areas of Computer Science.\n2. CSIE: BEng in Computer Science (Information Engineering)\nThis is a specialized undergraduate degree program focusing on the areas of multimedia computing and computer networking.\nWhile other Information Engineering programs in Hong Kong are closer to Electrical and Electronic Engineering, our CSIE program is unique in its emphasis on software. In fact, the CSIE program also satisfies all the general requirements of a typical Computer Science program. It has been carefully designed with the specific needs of Hong Kong in mind.\nBesides, the Department, jointly with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, also offers the BEng in Computer Engineering.\nA Spectrum of IT-Related Programs\nThe programs offered by our Department and the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering can be best viewed as the following spectrum:\nSoftware<----------------------->Hardware\nCOMP\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CSIE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CPEG\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EEIC\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ELEC\nGenerally speaking, the emphasis shifts from \"soft\" to \"hard\" as we move across the spectrum. The different programs suit different student interests and job market demands.\nOther Opportunities\nBesides the regular study programs, Computer Science students at HKUST also enjoy a number of other opportunities, including the following:\nOverseas exchange program:\nOne-year full-time overseas study by paying only HKUST's tuition fee\nWork-study program:\nOne-year full-time work outside HKUST after two years of study\nIndustrial training:\nTraining modules during winter and summer breaks on specific practical skills\nEnglish training:\nIntensive training in written and conversational English, including presentation skills\nFinal year projects:\nOne year project in an area of specialization under the guidance of faculty advisors\nStudent tutors:\nSecond and third year student helpers providing help to students in first-year courses\nOur Graduates\nAbout 20% of our graduates choose to pursue postgraduate study immediately after graduation. While many of them stayed in HKUST for MPhil (Master of Philosophy) study, some went abroad to study at top universities, including Stanford University, University of Southern California, University of Toronto, University of Texas at Austin, and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\nThose who choose to work found excellent jobs. While graduates from related disciplines also look for computing related jobs, Computer Science graduates clearly have great advantages after completing a comprehensive program that provides solid training in fundamentals and many emerging areas of IT and computing.\nInquiries\nStudents who need advice or assistance on application procedures, choice of programs, entrance requirements or other related matters are welcome to contact us:",
